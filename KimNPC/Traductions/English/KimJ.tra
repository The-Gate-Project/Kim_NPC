@0= ~You... I... Oh, my head! I can't remember anything... what are we doing here? The last thing I remember...~ 
@1= ~Bodhi! She... she bit me, and... and her eyes were red, so red... Oh, <CHARNAME>, what happened?~
@2= ~Bodhi had transformed you into a vampire, but I've killed her, and we removed the curse.~ 
@3= ~You've been miserably kidnapped by Bodhi, and you seriously delayed me until I killed you.~
@4= ~It doesn't matter anymore, now. You're alright, and that's all that counts!~ 
@5= ~You... you have done all this for me? All those efforts to resurrect me? Oh, my love, I... I am so... so happy that...~
@6= ~(You see Kim's eyes shine with a dangerous glimmer) I... I see. Well, I'm sorry to be a dead weight for you, <CHARNAME>, while I had hoped being able to help you.~
@7= ~Well, you failed. Because of your blundering, you almost got me killed!~ 
@8= ~You already help me just by being close, my love. You give me your strength and your courage.~
@9= ~You... you're right, my love. Even if I can’t imagine everything you had to go through, so that we can be together again... Oh, <CHARNAME>...~ 
@10= ~(Kim tries to avoid sobbing, without success. You see a tear running down her cheek, then another. Before you can react, she buries her face against your shoulder, and begins to cry.)~
@11= ~It's... it's nothing, it's the dust... It will pass... My eyes are... irritated.~
@12= ~(You do not reply and keep her tight against you. Your two hearts beat in unison while her hands grab your torso and squeeze you strongly, very strongly, as if she was afraid that you would leave and she would be alone.)~ 
@13= ~Th... thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you, my love.~
@14= ~(Her hands slide down your back, and caress your buttocks. She smiles through her tears, and then kisses you. This is Kim you know!)~ 
@15= ~(Kim remains upright, eyes dry, overwhelmed by the conflicting emotions that you triggered in her. When she finally speaks, her voice is sad.)~
@16= ~I guess I have to thank you for saving me despite my incompetence, <CHARNAME>. You... you mean too much to me, and I couldn't bear it to put you at risk again.~
@17= ~It is better that I go, I have to leave you... I... I...~
@18= ~(She closes her eyes when the tears finally flow, but she ignores them and miserably smiles at you. She comes closer to you, kisses you on the cheek, then starts to run out of the dungeon. You watch her leave... You don't stop her.)~ 
@19= ~Well, you did not stay very long with that priestess, <CHARNAME>. What happened? You... you didn't do anything with her, did you?~ [kim]
@20= ~Of course not! You know you're the only one that matters to me.~ 
@21= ~If I had slept with her, I would have been even more entangled in her web of intrigue.~ 
@22= ~And I was wrong not to. I wonder if I shouldn't return to see her...~
@23= ~Too late, she's gone. You missed your chance with her, <CHARNAME>. In any case, don't count on me to listen to you any further...~ 
@24= ~And that is the only reason you didn't do it? I... see. Very well, <CHARNAME>. You are a free person, after all.~
@25= ~I... It's...~
@26= ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@27= ~(She doesn't reply and just smiles tenderly at you. You can read an enormous confidence in her eyes.)~
@28= ~It... it's been eight hours that you've been locked away with her, <CHARNAME>. And don't think I didn't hear her screams! The woman was screaming like a pig being slaughtered! B... Why did you do that, <CHARNAME>?~ [kim]
@29= ~I had no choice! Otherwise, she would have known that we are impostors!~
@30= ~I assure you that nothing happened in there!~
@31= ~I had a lot of fun with her, if you want to know...~
@32= ~How could I believe that you were any different from other men? You think and react with what you have in your pants! Oh, I was so stupid!~
@33= ~Are you trying to laugh at me? I tell you that I heard her screaming. Oh, you're certainly a good lover, <CHARNAME>. But do not count on me to verify it!~
@34= ~Oh yeah? Couldn't you tell her that you had a headache, or that you had made a vow of chastity, or any other excuse that could have crossed your brainless male skull? But no! How could I trust you?~
@35= ~Well, well, <CHARNAME>? You spent very little time with this priestess. Ha, yet I had the impression that she liked you... hmm, would you happen to be impotent?~
@36= ~Well, what noise! I couldn't close an eye for the entire night the way she screamed. Bravo, <CHARNAME>. What selflessness, to dedicate yourself to our cause so thoroughly! Ha...~
@37= ~Tell me, when I was travelling the Sword Coast, I heard of a certain <CHARNAME> who accomplished heroic acts like no one else. Was it you who I heard about?~ [Kim]
@38= ~Yes, it was me... I'm glad to see that people remember what I did!~
@39= ~No, it wasn't me. Such coincidences do exist, you know?~
@40= ~Yes, it was me... but my reputation is highly exaggerated.~
@41= ~You are paid to obey me, not to speak. Shut up and keep walking!~
@42= ~Well, our collaboration starts well...~
@43= ~Oh? That's probably true, the bards always tend to add to it. But you'd better take advantage of your reputation, rather than play it down...~
@44= ~So? Yet, I had the opportunity to see a picture of you in a guesthouse in Baldur's Gate, and it did look a lot like you. The age, the name, the appearance were all the same... many coincidences, don't you think?~
@45= ~Well, yes... It was me, in fact.~
@46= ~I assure you that it wasn't me... but I didn't think I was so famous... oops!~
@47= ~I told you no! Now leave me alone!~
@48= ~From the moment you entered the lair of the Shadow Thieves, I thought you reminded me of someone. That's why I accepted your offer in the end, to finally get some action and danger. You surely didn't think I work for just anyone...~
@49= ~Oh? And Renal was not "anyone", perhaps?~
@50= ~It doesn't prevent you asking for gold from me...~
@51= ~I see... What do you know of me?~
@52= ~That's it? Your curiosity is satisfied?~
@53= ~Yes, you work for me, thank you for reminding me. So, if I tell you to be silent, you’ll shut up, right?~
@54= ~My curiosity is burning hot, <CHARNAME>, hey...~
@55= ~What do you want to know, exactly?~
@56= ~I see... what do you already know of me?~ 
@57= ~But I actually like to talk with you. What did you want to ask?~
@58= ~And my curiosity, what do you do with it? I would like to know a little more about you, too.~
@59= ~Bah. I don't care about your curiosity. Be a nice girl and shut up!~
@60= ~I only know what the bards sing and the poets write, <CHARNAME>. It's equally much and little. It is said that you saved the Nashkel mines, prevented a war with Amn, solved the iron problems of the region, ruined the plans of the Iron Throne, and killed the demon Sarevok.~
@61= ~Indeed, all these stories were related. It seems impressive like that, but it was only one big conspiracy in the end.~
@62= ~I have only done my duty.~
@63= ~Bah! The bards always tend to exaggerate...~
@64= ~That's all? They let many facts fall into silence, I think. I also killed sirens, basilisks, goblins, hundreds of them...~
@65= ~This is a good summary of my adventures on the Sword Coast, yes.~
@66= ~And... does such a reputation... excite you?~
@67= ~Forget all these stories and concentrate on the road ahead, Kim. I don't pay you to chitchat.~
@68= ~I never work for free. It's a principle. But be assured, it's been 500 gold well spent. I certainly will prove my value to you in the coming days. But back to you...~
@69= ~Renal is someone interesting, whatever you may think. He has a funny sense of honour for a thief, and his humour is pretty... particular. But above all, he had good training rooms which allowed me to perfect my skills in disabling traps and cutting purses. Did you think it was at sea that I learned this? Anyway, the past is the past, and today I work for you. I would like to know more about my employer...~
@70= ~I don't really want to talk about myself right now, <CHARNAME>. You already know everything you need to know. The rest is... not so very important. But back to you.~
@71= ~Well, you could tell me about yourself, to start!~
@72= ~I wonder how much truth lies in the legend I heard about you. Everything can't be true!~
@73= ~Hey. I like courage and heroism, yes. But I'll judge that by what I witness myself. I don't rely on the stories of minstrels to judge the value of a man. Anyway, I admit that I envy you a little...~
@74= ~It is really fascinating. For someone so young, you have already experienced extraordinary adventures! Lucky you, <CHARNAME>...~
@75= ~It was not a game, Kim. Many people died, and friends as well.~
@76= ~Actually, I am a child of Bhaal... that is why my life is too frantic.~
@77= ~Yes, I must say that my life is interesting.~
@78= ~Hey... wait to see what the future holds!~
@79= ~You have surely lived your own tumultuous adventures as a pirate, no?~
@80= ~Didn't your mother ever tell you that pride was an ugly flaw? But I suppose it is normal to develop such a characteristic for someone who has experienced what you have.~
@81= ~I have no doubt about it, and it is good that you do recognize it. But every legend has a core of truth, and I am convinced that you are not someone ordinary, whatever you say.~
@82= ~Oh no, help! Don't tell me that you are one of those stupid righters of wrongs, humble, modest and selfless, always ready to sacrifice? I must be lucky...~
@83= ~Bah. Forget all these stories of chivalry and give me a smile. You see, it will be good. Alright? Can we continue our discussion?~
@84= ~Hopefully it will last! Yo-hoo, to us dragons, mind flayers and demons of all kinds! Irenicus, beware!~
@85= ~Yes, yes, and I am Elminster. I shaved my beard and grew breasts, but it's me... do you recognize me? Hey, <CHARNAME>, don't get me wrong, but I think if you had divine blood, no stupid mage could have captured you or kidnapped one of your friends. Well, that's what I think...~
@86= ~Let's hope so! My blood boils at the idea of danger! Yo-hoo, to us dragons, mind flayers and demons of all kinds! Irenicus, beware!~
@87= ~Hey, you can't imagine how right you are. Heroism, gold, blood, feelings... enough to inspire one or two songs, too. But then one has to ask, why the bards have never been interested in me. It's favouritism...~
@88= ~Just kidding, <CHARNAME>. But maybe one day I can tell you about my adventures.~
@89= ~I thought about what we were discussing last time, about your adventures on the Sword Coast. Who was Sarevok, exactly? I heard he was a demon, perhaps a glabrezuu, who came to sow terror and bring destruction to Baldur's Gate. Other stories mention dopplegangers. What is true about that?~ [Kim]
@90= ~Sarevok is... was my brother.~
@91= ~Sarevok was a child of Bhaal, and he possessed in him the essence of the Lord of Murder.~
@92= ~Sarevok was a child of Bhaal... like me.~
@93= ~Sarevok was the master of the Iron Throne. A merchant with dreams of glory, neither more nor less.~
@94= ~No matter who he was. All that matters is that he is dead and that his plans were thwarted.~
@95= ~Sarevok was weak. I ripped the heart out of him.~
@96= ~You annoy me with all your questions. Will you please shut up?~
@97= ~Well, <PRO_LADYLORD> is sensitive... well, I'm going to walk a little alone.~
@98= ~Oh. I see. Well, I'm happy for you, and I'm sure his heart must have been very pretty in your hand, but that does not answer my question. So who really was he?~
@99= ~You are not wrong. After all, it is the result that counts. Whether he was a vampire, a demon or a lycanthrope is of little importance.~
@100= ~A simple merchant? Hmm, I can't imagine a merchant, as clever as he might be, has had the means to implement plans of such complexity. I admit that I am a little disappointed. I expected more lyricism and heroism. Finally, all your exploits come down to having killed a fat merchant in the corridors of his shop...~
@101= ~It was not just that. Sarevok is... was my brother.~
@102= ~Sarevok was not just any merchant. He was a child of Bhaal, and possessed in him the essence of the Lord of Murder.~
@103= ~Sarevok was not just any merchant. He was a child of Bhaal... like me.~
@104= ~Bah, think what you want, woman, I don't care.~
@105= ~Do not believe that it was that easy. He was surrounded by men-at-arms, guards, outlaws and monsters of all kinds. And he knew how to fight. I assure you, the battle was as epic as you can imagine.~
@106= ~WHAT? He was... and you were...~
@107= ~A ch... what? Oh, I understand. That would explain a lot, indeed. I was wondering why Sarevok wanted to push Amn into a war, but I suppose, this could have fed souls to his deceased father. Yes, that must be it. And it would also fit with all these stories about his power and his demonic origins. Well, well, well... a child of Bhaal... this is interesting.~
@108= ~Your... your brother? What do you mean, your brother? I thought you had been adopted by Gorion, how can Sarevok be linked to you?~
@109= ~We are both children of Bhaal.~
@110= ~Oh, um... I mean... Sarevok was adopted, too.~
@111= ~Oh, um... I mean... I later learned that my real parents were those of Sarevok.~
@112= ~I'm starting to get tired of these questions. What is this, an interrogation?~
@113= ~I really don't want to offend you, <CHARNAME>, but I still have a question: if he was as powerful as you say, then how were you able to overcome him? I mean, you don't look so terrifying, seeing you like that...~
@114= ~Appearances can be deceiving. I am a child of Bhaal, too...~
@115= ~Appearances can be deceiving. I am very powerful, Kim...~
@116= ~Alone, I may be insignificant, but thanks to my friends, we become invincible. This is what Sarevok didn't understand.~
@117= ~Ah, friendship. Yes, it's enough to see the efforts you make to save Imoen to understand that friendship is something important to you. I understand better now how you managed to destroy Sarevok.~
@118= ~Yes, that's it... not to mention the fact that I am a child of Bhaal.~
@119= ~Don't be mistaken, Kim. My efforts aren't aimed at saving Imoen, but to get my revenge on Irenicus!~
@120= ~Yes, friends are very important to me. They are always there when I need them, and so am I.~
@121= ~Imoen is special to me. Do not think I would risk my life for just anyone.~
@122= ~Now that your curiosity is satisfied, can we finally get back to the road?~
@123= ~Pride is an ugly flaw. But it is better than false modesty, you're right. Hopefully our travels will show me how... powerful you are.~
@124= ~That is a depth of friendship that I have never known for anyone. It must be very enjoyable to be one of your friends, <CHARNAME>. Hopefully, these few days will let us know each other better. But hush, let's move on now.~
@125= ~I see... and I can understand your reaction. Life would be impossible if we were to help everyone, all the time, wouldn't it? But on the other hand, this would be a fine objective. Well, it's time that we move on, I begin to talk silly things.~
@126= ~Yes, yes, of course. I didn't have the intention to become intrusive.~
@127= ~Bah. It is always difficult to know, if you are making fun of me or if you tell the truth. It seems a bit hard to swallow, nonetheless, this story of divine essence. I think it is time that I have a little talk with your travelling companions...~
@128= ~I see... Well, in any case, I hope you will be able to kill him. This man seems formidable. But on the other hand, I suppose he is weak compared to Sarevok. Let's continue our journey, we will finish this discussion later.~
@129= ~Hey, you don't know how to lie, <CHARNAME>. You're all red, and your voice trembles. But I understand that you want to keep some things to yourself. Very well, I won't delve this subject. But can you at least tell me how you defeated him, brother or not?~
@130= ~I am more powerful than you can imagine, Kim.~
@131= ~I was surrounded by devoted friends, who have helped me thwart his plans, then destroy him.~
@132= ~No, I can't tell you. Shut up, and get moving!~
@133= ~In fact, <CHARNAME>, since we travel together... Have I already told you the reason I ended up in Athkatla?~ [kim]
@134= ~No, tell me.~
@135= ~No... it had something to do with a storm, didn't it?~
@136= ~Destiny... you knew you were going to meet a handsome <PRO_RACE> like me!~
@137= ~No, and I don't want to hear it. Content yourself in obeying me.~
@138= ~Well, go to hell. If we were on my ship, I would make you feel what it means to walk the plank, just to have some fun.~
@139= ~Yes, I suppose it must be that. A powerful voice made itself heard in my head, telling me "Go to Athkatla, Kim. A handsome <PRO_RACE> awaits you." The problem is that the voice didn't reveal that <PRO_HESHE> would be totally brainless! As for handsome, well...~
@140= ~But I digress, I digress. Where was I? Ah yes, the reasons for my arrival in Athkatla...~
@141= ~Hey, yeah, I guess you can say it like that...~
@142= ~It all began so suddenly. We sailed quietly towards the north along the coastline of Amn, loaded with the spoils of our previous looting. The atmosphere was tremendous. We were rich, we were drunk, but most of all... we were alive. I felt invulnerable that day, <CHARNAME>.~
@143= ~But the joy did not last long, as you can image. Very quickly, the sky went dark. The wind rose and the sea began agitating. Initially, we didn't worry, quite the contrary. A little wind would suit our business, pushing our sails to the ports of Baldur's Gate, where we could have slickly spent our gold for drinks and other delights.~
@144= ~Ah yes... what other pleasures are you referring to, Kim?~
@145= ~This is fascinating... and what happened then?~
@146= ~Could you please try to spare me the details and get directly to the point?~
@147= ~Superb, very interesting. Well, let's go now.~
@148= ~Nothing that would be particularly shocking, <CHARNAME>. Most of my companions spent every gold coin in the company of prostitutes. Like all men, they have only one idea in their mind: to satisfy their desires. Bah! Personally, I prefer more subtle pleasures... gambling, for example. I like the feeling of the dice in my hands and the sight of gold on the table, even though I generally do not have a coin left at the end of the night...~
@149= ~No prostitutes for you? The beautiful Kim is still a virgin?~
@150= ~Gambling, alcohol, women... pirates are truly the filthiest scum of the worst kind!~
@151= ~I see. Where were you with your story?~
@152= ~A gambler... that's exactly what we need now. Get out of my sight, before I throw you out of this group!~
@153= ~Sorry, but this is my way of telling things. If you don't like it, I will remain silent. What do you prefer?~
@154= ~Please continue, I am sorry to have interrupted you.~
@155= ~Don't bother to continue, in that case. I'm in no mood to listen to such a long history.~
@156= ~Don't think you are allowed to do just anything because we travel together, <CHARNAME>. I can be very sensitive on some subjects. Now, where were we?~
@157= ~You were telling me the story of your shipwreck.~
@158= ~You began a boring lengthy speech instead of going to the essentials. I hope you will be more brief when you continue.~
@159= ~Hah! I knew it! She's still a virgin!~
@160= ~Hey, I take it as a compliment. Well, where was I?~
@161= ~Ah yes, the shipwreck. Well, how can I explain... I suppose you know that pirates are not very popular in Amn. To tell the truth, we are hunted day and night by mercenaries, who seek to obtain royal favour by slaying us. And so, by misfortune, we ran into one of these privateer ships at the height of the storm.~
@162= ~Despite the raging elements, it started hunting us, and so we had to face them and fight. The battle was bloody, as you can imagine, and the storm did not make matters better. Our bows and crossbows were completely useless with such a wind. Everything was settled sword in hand, and the sea was tinted with blood. Hey. It was a great fight!~
@163= ~Who won?~
@164= ~Continue your story, I am listening.~
@165= ~You seem to have taken pleasure in killing these privateers. I thought that death and violence would affect you more...~
@166= ~It must have been frightening...~
@167= ~You like to listen to yourself talking, don't you? I've heard enough for today.~
@168= ~We did, of course, otherwise I would not be here to talk about it. Ha! We were the best crew that there could possibly be. And frankly, <CHARNAME>, have you seen me losing a fight? We were forty, they were twice as much. But they stood no chance!~
@169= ~I enjoy fighting. I never feel so alive as in the midst of a fight, when my blades sing and I dance with death. I've never felt so alive than in these moments. But if you don't stop interrupting me, I will end up losing track... ah, yes!~
@170= ~Frightening? Exciting, you mean! I'm not a frightened little girl, <CHARNAME>. Oh, no, quite the contrary! I was at the top of happiness!~
@171= ~After several minutes of struggle, the last three privateers alive surrendered. The ship's deck was crowded with bodies, and we were only sixteen that remained alive, including two seriously wounded. But our problems were not solved yet, however. Even with the three privateers, there was no way to steer our ship on such a sea, with a crew so reduced. Less than twenty people, when we would have needed more than thirty! The outcome was foreseeable...~
@172= ~So that's when your ship sunk?~
@173= ~These privateers were stupid to attack in such conditions. Even if they would have won, they would have faced the same problems, right?~
@174= ~Why spare the three privateers? I didn't know you were so respectful for the lives of others.~
@175= ~Does this story end soon? It's been hours that you keep speaking...~
@176= ~Oh, it was not about pity, <CHARNAME>, but of necessity. We were so few to control the ship, it would have been a real waste to kill them. And we knew they would do everything possible to help us, they were in the same... boat, literally.~
@177= ~They were nearly eighty, <CHARNAME>. I don't think they imagined losing as many men. I think they quickly regretted that they had attacked our ship...~
@178= ~What comes is not difficult to guess. Blown by the storm like a drinking straw, the sail torn down, the rudder broken, our vessel eventually went aground on the rocks bordering Athkatla. It was a terrifying moment, <CHARNAME>, terrifying. I thought I was going to die that day, when the water closed down on me. But I did not lose hope. I was not wearing armor, and that's what prevented me from drowning like the others. I caught a piece of wood and I drifted amid the lighting until finally, the storm calmed down and I was stranded on a beach south of the city.~
@179= ~Well, that was a real adventure! Life as a pirate isn't easy, it seems...~
@180= ~For someone who loves courting death, I am surprised that this shipwreck terrified you, as you say.~
@181= ~I'm sorry to hear that you have suffered so much... Life was not easy for you.~
@182= ~That's it? Your story is FINALLY over?~
@183= ~Oh, I don't complain, <CHARNAME>. I have certainly been more fortunate than those who perished in the fight or in the shipwreck. By thinking about it, it is a miracle that I am still alive. You see, somehow, life has not been so cruel. I don't need your compassion, but I thank you.~
@184= ~There is a difference between dying weapons in hand, and dying drowned in a storm. And then, at my age, one feels invulnerable. It's strange to feel your own mortality... but I will not engage in such morbid discussions.~
@185= ~Hey, you said it. But the worst disasters are the best stories. Those to whom nothing ever happens can't tell anything to their children...~
@186= ~And now, perhaps it is time to get back to the road, right? I didn't think my story would take so long... Thanks for being stoic and hearing me all through the end. I know I speak a lot, sometimes!~
@187= ~I find it hard to admit, but it seems to be the truth... you are a child of Bhaal! It's really unbelievable...~ [Kim]
@188= ~But what could you have felt when you learned about this? It had to be an unbelievable shock to you, no?~
@189= ~You could say so, yes. As if my whole world collapsed...~
@190= ~Yes and no. I have always been convinced that I was different... superior to mere mortals...~
@191= ~Alas, poor me! As someone who was always a child of joy, I had to learn that I was a child of Bhaal!~
@192= ~The revelation came slowly, in fact. Signs, dreams, fragments of memory... I had time to gradually get used to this idea.~
@193= ~You're boring me, Kim. Shut up and walk!~
@194= ~Very well. No more talking... and I walk.~
@195= ~I see. Perhaps it was easier to accept that way, bit by bit...~
@196= ~Hey! For an offspring of the Lord of Murder, I must say that you are happier than I would have expected!~
@197= ~Superior, huh? Be careful, <CHARNAME>. Divine child or not, that kind of attitude won't take you very far...~
@198= ~Yes, I can understand that. It is already difficult for an orphan to hear about its parents...~
@199= ~In this case, what's more, it's not just any God... the Lord of Murder in person? It must be harder to bear than being the descendant of Mystra or Akadia or I don't know what other god or goddess. How can you bear that thought?~
@200= ~Actually, I'm pretty happy about it. My father was powerful, and I walk in his footsteps.~
@201= ~The important part are the powers this status grants me. The rest doesn't matter.~
@202= ~You don't chose your examples very well. I don't want to be the descendant of Mystra for anything in the world, given all the enemies that the goddess must have...~
@203= ~It's not because my father was a god that this changes anything, Kim. I am the master of my own destiny, today and tomorrow.~
@204= ~Maybe I'm here to redeem his crimes? Perhaps, where he killed and murdered, I can soothe and heal?~
@205= ~I can't stand all this theological bla-bla-bla. Leave me alone.~
@206= ~Hmm... strange... I suppose I should envy you for this paternity, you seem to like so much, and yet I think, I pity you.~
@207= ~But you can't ignore where your powers come from, can you? Each time you use them, they remind you of your dreadful parentage...~
@208= ~Hey! You're right, <CHARNAME>, that was not the best example. Mystra is threatened from all sides and stands alone against everyone. But Bhaal too had this problem... of public relations.~
@209= ~These are words that warm my heart! You're right, of course. It is the education that you received, and the experiences that you have lived that have made of you, what you are now... not a few drops of black blood. And that is so much better, because I really wouldn't envy someone, who would try to follow in the footsteps of Bhaal...~
@210= ~Bah, that's guilt speaking again. You never knew your father and you are not responsible for his actions! I have the impression that you feel convicted to do good things, to make all the evil that your father has spread in the world forgotten. This is ridiculous. You do not owe him anything! You do not owe anything to anyone! Still, I suppose your attitude has somehow provided you with many friends... admirers... almost a family...~
@211= ~One must feel terribly alone, when you are the Lord of Murder... You wield an unbelievable power, but you have no friends, no soul mates, no companions...~
@212= ~A ship can be wonderful and capable of crossing the Trackless Seas without ever sinking... Yet without crew, where would it go?~
@213= ~Ah, now I speak in stupid metaphors... I think it is time to continue our way before I start to sound ridiculous. Hey, smile a little, <CHARNAME>, and forget all these depressing thoughts!~
@214= ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, have you ever heard of the pirate Greenbeard?~ [kim]
@215= ~Hmm... no? But I suppose it won't last any longer...~
@216= ~Vaguely... he's a pirate plundering the Sword Coast, right?~
@217= ~Greenbeard? What a ridiculous name!~
@218= ~No, and I don't want to hear about him.~
@219= ~Always so pleasant, I see. I thought I could rely on you, but it seems I was wrong...~
@220= ~Yes, it is a ridiculous name. And that's exactly why he has chosen it.~
@221= ~Not only. He also sailed close to Waterdeep, Icewind Dale... Yes, he is a pirate, but it is a bit too simple to think of him only as a man of the seas.~
@222= ~Hey. I see that you are starting to get used to my stories. That's good, <CHARNAME>!~
@223= ~His name is a joke, actually. I remember that I asked him once. He said that only the weak chose windy names to impress others, and that it is by his deeds that he intends to make himself known.~
@224= ~And even if he is not as famous as others - as Saemon Havarian, for example - he is becoming increasingly influential and powerful on the seas he sails.~
@225= ~And? Why are you telling me about him?~
@226= ~Such acts will not remain unpunished! One day, that pirate will meet the adversary he deserves!~
@227= ~And he really has a green beard?~
@228= ~Another uninteresting story. Forget it, Kim, you don't know how to tell stories.~
@229= ~I wanted to raise this issue, because it is possible that... he's somewhat angry at me.~
@230= ~Hmm... you should be careful what you say, <CHARNAME>. I am a pirate, too, don't forget that. And I do not particularly appreciate your comments.~ 
@231= ~Yes, really. He has painted it with the algae dye. Hey, I thought he looked ridiculous... until one gazes in his cold eyes, so cold. Eyes of a killer.~
@232= ~I was part of his crew for almost a year, and it was probably the best time of my life. Until the day, he took an interest in me for other reasons... other than simple camaraderie between pirates.~
@233= ~Ha! I saw that one coming as big as a house! And you expect me to protect you from him, right?~
@234= ~I can understand him. Sometimes, looking at you, I start to feel that kind of desires...~
@235= ~I guess it must be difficult to live your life at sea on a ship filled with men...~
@236= ~Well... actually... but wait until I tell you the whole story, before making your decision.~
@237= ~You're not very good at compliments, <CHARNAME>. Put your hormones at rest, it's your help that I need right now.~
@238= ~You must fight every day to prove that you deserve your place. Hey, but after I castrated two of them, the other let me be, who knows why. Anyway, Greenbeard is not just any pirate...~
@239= ~I left quietly one night, taking with me the contents of his trunk and some interesting magical items. A true treasure! I boarded a dinghy and I rowed to the shore.~
@240= ~As you can imagine, it didn't take long before I had spent all this gold. Soon, I found myself without a single coin. The only thing that was left to me was this hood, which I couldn't convince myself to sell. Its magic was too useful for me, it allows me to fight more skilfully than before.~
@241= ~Anyway, since I did not want to sell the hood, I had no choice. I looked for a ship that accepted me, and I went aboard... with the ending that you already know. But during the few months I spent on that ship, I learned that Greenbeard was looking for me. He wanted to make me pay for what he saw as a betrayal.~
@242= ~Don't worry, nothing will happen to you. You're part of the group, now, and no one will hurt you.~
@243= ~And you are telling me that now? I have enough troubles with my own quest and the countless monsters who hunt me, I don't need to face pirates on top of that! Leave right now, your presence endangers us all.~
@244= ~Greenbeard was not necessarily wrong... you could have left without taking the contents of his trunk, right? He would probably have looked for you less eagerly.~
@245= ~You're an adept swashbuckler, Kim, and you have improved even more since we travel together. What makes this pirate so special that you are so afraid of him?~
@246= ~That's nice, <CHARNAME>. I know I can count on you. But there is something that I did not tell you...~
@247= ~I... see. Well, if you take it like that, I will no longer endanger your most valuable person, not for a second. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. You are truly a worthy child of the Lord of Murder!~
@248= ~You... you're not wrong, but you were not in my situation! How could I have made my living, if I didn't take the gold with me? And then, it's easy for you to talk about principles, you who raids all houses and all the trunks you see!~
@249= ~Nevertheless, the question is not why he continues to hunt me, but rather how to stop him. And it may not be easy.~
@250= ~If only it was that simple... but he is not an ordinary pirate.~
@251= ~Greenbeard is a dangerous warrior, a master of the scimitar, unlike any other. But the troubles don't stop there. I saw with my eyes, how he got struck by a sword into the heart, during a boarding. He should have died. Everyone would have died instantly, tough or not. But he only laughed, and he killed the man who had injured him, then he quietly removed the sword from his chest. The wound had disappeared in seconds!~
@252= ~I'm not easily scared, <CHARNAME>, but knowing this man is chasing after me, one way or another, terrifies me.~
@253= ~So? Do you think you could help me, if Greenbeard decided to come over here and attack me?~
@254= ~All this changes nothing. You're part of the group, Kim, and I will never let you down.~
@255= ~And you are telling me that now? I have enough troubles with my own quest and the countless monsters who hunt me, I don't need to face an invulnerable pirate on top of that! Leave right now, your presence endangers us all.~
@256= ~Is there no way to talk to him about this? Give him back his gold, perhaps? How much did you steal?~
@257= ~My blood boils at the thought of meeting someone so powerful. Finally a worthy opponent! I will protect you, Kim. Not for you, but to satisfy my thirst for combat.~
@258= ~You're unbelievable, <CHARNAME>, you know that? Thank you for your words. You don't know how happy this makes me... but we'll see if you are as courageous and resolute when he will show up. Hey, this promises to be fun!~
@259= ~Hmm, I don't think so... Summed up, I've stolen more than ten thousand pieces of gold, including the magical objects. And some of these had probably a special value for him beside their market price. No, I don't think we can convince him to give up. He has a rather particular notion of revenge...~
@260= ~Hmm... I guess I have to thank you. Whatever your reasons are, you will fight for me. I wish you courage, dear <CHARNAME>. It promises to be a hell of a battle... if ever, he finds us.~
@261= ~Anyway, for now we are safe. Who knows, maybe he will never find us? Come on, it is time to continue your own quest.~
@262= ~You fight pretty well, <CHARNAME>. I admit that I am impressed. But tell me, what motivated you to learn the arts of combat? This surely wasn't a decision you took lightly, was it?~ [Kim]
@263= ~Actually, I like melee fighting. Feeling the blood spurt on my face, seeing the terrified expression of my enemies...~
@264= ~I didn't have sufficient faith in the gods, I refused to steal to survive, and magic didn't interest me. What else could I become?~
@265= ~There is a certain nobility in melee fighting that always attracted me. I prefer to face someone with a weapon in hand rather than carbonizing him with a snap of my fingers...~
@266= ~Well, when I was young I took combat poses in front of the mirror at Winthrop's Inn, and I thought they looked good on me...~
@267= ~To know how to fight, that is the definition of power. The more skilled you are, the more powerful you are. And I am without equal.~
@268= ~More questions? You never stop, huh?~
@269= ~Yes, it shows that I care for you, don't you see. But, if you're too stupid and selfish to take the time to answer me...~
@270= ~Well, that is modesty... I suppose it shouldn't surprise me, coming from you. And yet...~
@271= ~Hey, I can very well imagine how you proudly paraded in your room. I regret not having seen it. But, more seriously...~
@272= ~It's true, I can perfectly understand you. I too feel the same thing. Ah, the pleasure to cross swords for glory and honor! Hmm, even if sometimes the honor is secondary. Anyway...~
@273= ~I see... a forced choice? That's rather a pity. There is nobility in melee fighting. Without warriors, kingdoms would not exist. On the other side...~
@274= ~Ewww... it's disgusting, <CHARNAME>. But I guess everyone finds his pleasure where he can. Anyway, I guess that does also answer my second question.~
@275= ~Have you never looked back? Do you sometimes regret you couldn't do anything else? To change your life completely?~
@276= ~Yes... to become a farmer or someone harmless that nobody chases after...~
@277= ~My vocation is my life. Change? Never, not for all the gold in the world!~
@278= ~Ah, to become a warrior, feared and respected!~
@279= ~Ah, to become a ranger, to understand animals and fight their enemies!~
@280= ~Ah, to speak vows as a paladin, and defend widow and orphan throughout Faerûn!~
@281= ~Ah, to speak vows as a paladin, and defend widows and orphans throughout Faerûn!~
@282= ~Ah, to be a cleric, to follow the mysterious paths of the gods, to understand and fulfill their plans...~
@283= ~Ah, to become a druid, to feel nature move inside of me, to protect and to cherish her...~
@284= ~Ah, being a thief, the thrill of picking locks and hiding in shadows...~
@285= ~Ah, to become a bard... to influence people with my music, to bring them happiness and joy...~
@286= ~Ah, to become a mage or a sorcerer... to be able to launch fireballs and stop time!~
@287= ~I see... it is rather understandable, given all the troubles you face at the moment. But are you truly happy, <CHARNAME>? I am not sure this is you...~
@288= ~Hey, I'm happy to see you take things like that. You're right! No remorse, always look forward! Yo-hoo, and now a bottle of rum!~
@289= ~Hey, the way of the warrior, huh? A good choice... myself, I sometimes wonder if I shouldn't have concentrated more on my fighting skills, rather than learning how to pick locks and how to steal.~
@290= ~Hey, the way the ranger, huh? I never really understood these strange birds. They have always seemed to me a bit too shy and introverted for my tastes. If you want my opinion, they spend too much time with animals, and too little with us...~
@291= ~Oh, no, please! Don't tell me that you would like to become even MORE helpful? We are already running across Faerûn for days, to help any moron who needs help! After all, I must confess that you would make a proud paladin, with your stupid ideas and your irreproachable behaviour...~
@292= ~Oh, no, please! These tin cans without humour... You realize that you would have to run from the left to the right, to help every moron who needs help, with the only satisfaction the pleasure of having done your duty? Oh, no, no thank you.~
@293= ~Hey... you, a paladin? Don't make me laugh, you have no principles... and that is so much better this way! I can't stand these stupid tin cans that run from the left to the right, helping every moron who needs help, with the only satisfaction the pleasure of having done their duty.~
@294= ~A cleric? Hmm, I don't know, I've never had much respect for those who abandoned their free will in the hands of so-called superior powers. I prefer to think I control my life, and I think those who are trying to persuade themselves of the contrary are cowards, who refuse to look the truth in the eyes. Hey, I don't say this about you, of course, <CHARNAME>!~
@295= ~A druid? Hmm, this is a strange choice, but why not? Personally, I am not so keen on this idea. If the druids were more numerous, nature would certainly be more protected, greener and healthier... but we would not have these beautiful cities, with their inns and their gambling rooms!~
@296= ~A thief like me? Oh, you know, it isn't such a pleasant life, <CHARNAME>. People look through you, and nobody seems to value the work you are doing - except adventurers who need you, just to detect traps and to open locks... and then, you are told "thank you very much, mister thief, and goodbye!"~
@297= ~A bard? I can understand that you want to become one, <CHARNAME>. Me too, they make me dream. It's such a happy life, so carefree! And then, I have already faced some Master Blades in a duel. All of them have lost, what did you think? But they fought well...~
@298= ~That is an aspiration of many people, it seems. The power granted by magic is tempting, it's true... but would you be able to spend hours over your books to learn the necessary spells, if you were a mage? Or, know that at any moment, if you ever lose control, you could unintentionally cast a spell, if you were a sorcerer? That's not for me, no it isn't.~
@299= ~That's an interesting choice, anyway. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I feel like I know a little more about you, now.~
@300= ~I had many prejudices about rangers, <CHARNAME>, but I start changing my opinion. For me, they were all old misanthropes, fleeing the company of others, preferring animals to humans... Hey, I don't blame them! But how did you become a ranger, yourself?~ [Kim]
@301= ~I wanted to become a master archer. The rangers have the best teachers. Thanks to them, no one with a bow in his hand bests me.~
@302= ~I... *ahem*... I like animals.~
@303= ~I like the combat style of the rangers guild. With a blade in each hand I am invincible!~
@304= ~You have said it yourself... Animals are often better company than men. I am here to defend them.~
@305= ~I must confess that I've never thought about it. An old ranger in Candlekeep taught me their ways, and I've never looked back since.~
@306= ~You're right, Kim, I prefer animals to humans. Now go away, I would rather talk to my horse than to you!~
@307= ~I see... yes, bows are powerful weapons... although I think it is nobler to face someone in close combat. But I recognize there is beauty in some arrows you have learned to fire so elegantly. However...~
@308= ~Hey! I suspected this! But you're right, it's probably one of the best reasons to become a ranger, but...~
@309= ~Yes, you're right. It is a style that I favour as well. But be careful when you say you are invincible... Hey, maybe some day, I will try to take that title from you at the tip of my rapier! Bah, anyway...~
@310= ~Mmhh... I hope this is not a subtle way to make me understand that my conversations are boring. Hey, don't run away like that, I would still like to ask you something!~
@311= ~I see... it's a way like another to start your life. But in fact, speaking about looking back...~
@312= ~Well, <CHARNAME>, I still can't believe it. Me, the pirate, travelling alongside a paladin! Hey, if I had been told that one day... but I wonder... what made you join this order? Why did you suddenly decide that, hey, you were now going to save widows and orphans?~ [Kim]
@313= ~This is not something one decides, Kim. It is a vocation that you embrace.~
@314= ~There must be someone to defend those who can't defend themselves.~
@315= ~I don't appreciate your sarcasm very much, Kim.~
@316= ~It's the white armor. I love white armor, even if it stains easily. So I told myself, "let's become a paladin, and we will have a white armor!"~
@317= ~I must confess that I've never thought about it. An old paladin trained me in Candlekeep, and everything seemed quite... natural.~
@318= ~This conversation is boring me already. Forget it.~
@319= ~Yes, and it must be the only thing you embrace, knowing your rigid morals! Hey, don't do these big eyebrows, I know all too well that you are too noble to touch a girl, pure and innocent like me! Hmm, which makes me think...~
@320= ~I... suppose that is true, although I tend to think they could try to manage their problems themselves, rather than waving their arms, calling out for adventurers to rescue them. Anyway, does this never start to weigh on you?~
@321= ~And I don't appreciate your lack of humour so much, so I guess it's a tie. Hey, that makes me think...~
@322= ~You're right. Your armor suits you well, actually. A little muddy, slightly dented, but I suppose these things happen. Oh well, that makes me think...~
@323= ~Clerics have always been a source of fascination for me. To see those people bow before any deity to obtain bribes of power, I find it so despicable... but in your case, <CHARNAME> it is even more surprising. You, a child of Bhaal, you pray to other gods?~ [Kim]
@324= ~This is not something one decides, Kim. It is the gods who choose us.~
@325= ~I admit that the situation makes me laugh too, sometimes...~
@326= ~I would appreciate it if you kept your blasphemy for yourself, Kim.~
@327= ~The gods are not so easily bribed as you imagine. Greetings Lathander, my friend! Kookoo, Helm! Hey, Talos, how are you doing, old boy?~
@328= ~I must confess that I've never thought about it. An old cleric led me to faith back in Candlekeep, and everything seemed quite... natural.~
@329= ~Well, always those fatalistic stories... it is disgusting! You should be a little more confident, <CHARNAME>, your determinism weighs on my health.~
@330= ~Perhaps there will be a time, when you will become as powerful as the god you pray to... What will you do, then? How could you hang on to your faith? Will you remain a cleric of a power you no longer believe in?~
@331= ~Hey! That is reassuring... I didn't think that the powers above would appreciate this kind of behaviour, but I can tell you that this is heart-warming! That said...~
@332= ~Aaah... nature and little birds... tell me, <CHARNAME>, what made you take the responsibilities of a druid? It mustn't be easy every day! The balance here, and balance there, and oh the poor ladybug, and splash, there's the nice water lily... Aargh, how do you support all this without a lot of pain in your skull?~ [Kim]
@333= ~This is not something one decides, Kim. It's nature that chooses us.~
@334= ~It was a green hideout where a river sings... I love nature, Kim. It deserves to be protected, and that is what I do.~
@335= ~I don't like how you speak of nature very much, Kim.~
@336= ~Plants are our friends, we must love them too. Like us, they have a soul...~
@337= ~I must confess that I've never thought about it. An old druid show me how to worship nature back in Candlekeep, and everything seemed quite... natural.~
@338= ~Mmmh... I must say that the answer does not really satisfy me. But, let's just imagine,... What would have happened if she hadn't chosen you?~
@339= ~What passion in your voice! Yes, I can understand that you love what you do... but let's image that you weren't a druid?~
@340= ~Haha, agreed, well I deserved it. But you have to admit, that it is an occupation that may seem overwhelming, taking care of all those groves, isn't it? Do you ever have regrets?~
@341= ~I was wondering... <CHARNAME>, You're a thief too, like me. But I don't take great pleasure in this work. I much prefer to only rely on my combat skills. And you? Are you a thief by choice or necessity? You had a golden childhood, after all?~ [Kim] 
@342= ~You speak of a golden childhood! No, Gorion made me lead a very austere life, without gold nor alcohol... somehow I had to get some of these!~
@343= ~Gold is power. Thieves have gold. It's as simple as that.~
@344= ~I don't like your manners, Kim. Being a thief is nothing dishonourable.~
@345= ~Okay, I'll explain, but first... I'll give you back your purse!~
@346= ~I must confess that I've never thought about it. An old guild master taught me his talents back in Candlekeep. How to disarm or to set traps, how to hide... if he only knew what I am now, huh?~
@347= ~Hey, I will *so sorry* for you... I am sure you didn't miss anything, but you just had an adolescence crisis. Typical! However, I understand what you mean. Neither did I have a choice. And if it were to done again?~
@348= ~Mmmh. There are other ways to get gold. You could have become a merchant, a lawyer, a notary... and then, don't tell me that the few coins you steal can be compared to the thousands of gold coins that we collect by killing monsters? No, I really don't understand your motivation... but assuming you were given a second chance?~
@349= ~... I don't know if I should laugh or you pierce your heart. Hey, beware, <CHARNAME>, I am very ticklish about what affects my business! Anyway, I see that you are doing rather well. But assuming you were given a second chance?~
@350= ~Some notes of music, some spells, a skilled blade. I've always been fascinated by bards. Not specializing, but reaching into all areas, it's a choice like any other. What made you become a bard, <CHARNAME>?~ [kim]
@351= ~It is not something one decides, Kim. It is music that chooses us.~
@352= ~You have already said it: I like to look into several disciplines at the same time, play the amateur rather than the specialist...~
@353= ~Manipulating the crowd is the real power, Kim. To cause anger and violence at will is something... exciting.~
@354= ~Well, I felt that my handsome body and my dreamy voice should exist for posterity!~
@355= ~I must confess that I've never thought about it. A minstrel visiting Candlekeep taught me his art, and I have patiently trained since. I didn't think I would be travelling as much, at the time.~
@356= ~Well said! But I shouldn't expect anything else from you. <CHARNAME> with the golden words, huh. I find it hard to imagine you in another profession. But what if...~
@357= ~Yes, I see. But it must be frustrating sometimes, not to be able to advance in a discipline as much as you would like. To be a worse spell caster than a mage, a worse swordsman than a fighter and a worse pickpocket than a thief...~
@358= ~Uhhhh... I shouldn't have asked this question, and I should continue to see you as someone natural and carefree. Bah, anyway...~
@359= ~Hey! I see, I see. I find it hard to imagine you as something other than a bard, I must say. But let's suppose some events had happened differently?~
@360= ~The more I look at you using magic, the more impressed I am, <CHARNAME>. You hold great power in your hands. But tell me, what made you choose this path, exactly? I mean, when you are young, the idea of spending your whole life reading books, isn't necessarily tempting, is it?~ [kim]
@361= ~The power is worth it, Kim. I sacrificed several years to study, but I am now as powerful as I had hoped.~
@362= ~It is true, when I look back, I sometimes wonder if it was worth it...~
@363= ~I love to study. I love the smell of parchment and potions that are mixed. Magic is my passion, Kim.~
@364= ~Actually, I was looking for a love potion that Imoen should swallow, and...~
@365= ~I must confess that I've never thought about it. Gorion taught me what he knew, and I automatically followed in his footsteps.~
@366= ~So that was the ambition that pushed you to study? Yes, I can understand that. And obviously you weren't wrong to prepare as you did, given the challenges that you have to face now. But do you have regrets sometimes?~
@367= ~Ah, regrets... I began to wonder if you were able to feel those, you are always so self-confident. Hey, don't worry, I'm convinced that you made the right choice. You seem to be okay as you are, today. But imagine you would have taken a different path?~
@368= ~Well, well. So much life in your eyes, suddenly! I didn't except that you had such a capturing relationship with magic, <CHARNAME>. I guess my next question will seem ridiculous to you, in that case... but I will ask it anyway, ha!~
@369= ~Yuck... don't tell me more, I don't want to know more. Hey, I guess you had to feel lonely at Candlekeep... Well, anyway, you seem to have found your way. Do you think things might have turned out differently?~
@370= ~The power is worth it, Kim. I sacrificed several years to work out, but I am now as powerful as I had hoped.~
@371= ~If only I wasn't born with magic inside me, I might have been able to do something else...~
@372= ~I love focusing my powers. I love the smell of a fireball crackling and that of stoneskins building up. The magic is my passion, Kim.~
@373= ~I had little choice, Kim. Magic is a part of me as a sorcerer. I can only thank Gorion for teaching me what he knew.~
@374= ~Here, <CHARNAME>, I have a little riddle for you, just to pass the time between two fights!~ [kim]
@375= ~Oh, don't frown like that, it's simply about guessing the number of duels that I won since I became a pirate. These are the clues:~
@376= ~Among the pirates that I faced, there were one-eyed ones and one-armed ones. Twice as many one-eyed than one-armed pirates actually, not counting the pirate who had lost both an eye and an arm. And if I count all my duels, I faced 24 hands and 21 eyes.~
@377= ~The question is simple: How many pirates did I fight?~
@378= ~11?~
@379= ~12?~
@380= ~14?~
@381= ~15?~
@382= ~18?~
@383= ~20?~
@384= ~24?~
@385= ~I have no idea!~
@386= ~And you take pleasure in fighting against opponents with disabilities?~
@387= ~Leave me alone with your stupid questions.~
@388= ~Stupid questions? Bah, admit that you are too stupid to answer, that's all!~
@389= ~Come on, it's not that difficult. 24 hands and 21 eyes, how many more one-eyed than one-armed pirates? It's actually 3 more, isn't it? So if you know that there were 3 one-eyed pirates more than one-armed ones, and I told you there were twice as many, that means that I faced 6 one-eyed pirates and 3 one-armed pirates, doesn't it? Always excluding the one who was both at the same time. So, come on, try again!~
@390= ~Uh, no...~
@391= ~You give up, or do you want to find the answer by yourself?~
@392= ~I wouldn't mind a hint...~
@393= ~I give up!~
@394= ~Let me find the answer...~
@395= ~Well, that's a pity, I would have preferred that you find it on your own. The correct answer was 14 duels, including 3 against one-armed pirates, 6 against one-eyed pirates, and against the one-eyed, one-armed pirate. Hey!~
@396= ~Well done! You're absolutely right. 14 duels, including 3 against one-armed pirates, 6 against one-eyed pirates, and one duel against the one-eyed, one-armed pirate. Hey, you are rather quick-witted, <CHARNAME>. I like that...~
@397= ~It was simple... 21 eyes and 24 hands, that meant there were 3 more one-eyed ones than one-armed ones. As I told you there were twice as many, that means that I faced 6 one-eyed ones and 3 one-armed ones.~
@398= ~There are 21 eyes... So we have 6 eyes of the 6 one-eyed pirates, and 6 eyes of the 3 one-armed pirates, and the eye of the pirate who was both one-eyed and one-armed, which equals to 13 eyes. So there are 8 eyes remaining, which means four pirates in good health. Thus the answer: 4 pirates in good health, 3 one-armed ones, 6 one-eyed ones and the one-eyed, one-armed pirate equals 14 duels!~
@399= ~Hey, I like testing people like that. Small riddles are fun to pass time. But I suppose there are quests to be completed, dragons to be killed and vampires to be burned. Let's move on, <CHARNAME>, and thank you for playing this game with me!~
@400= ~Hey, relax, <CHARNAME>, it's only a riddle! I purely invented the number of crippled ones, just to complicate things for you... However, the number of duels won is correct.~
@401= ~You gaze strangely at me, <CHARNAME>. Is there something I can do for you?~ [Kim]
@402= ~In fact, I have a question. Can you tell me how a girl like you became a pirate?~
@403= ~I was thinking that you are very attractive...~
@404= ~Yes, shut up and keep moving.~
@405= ~Hah! I noticed that your look was not innocent. Well, cease drooling on me for the future...~
@406= ~That might be difficult!~
@407= ~In that case, shut up and leave me alone.~
@408= ~I'll make things easier for you by walking far away from you...~
@409= ~Hmpff... Very well.~
@410= ~"A girl like me", huh? Hey, I wonder how I should take this. It is true, it's been a long time that we travel together, <CHARNAME>, yet I've never told you about myself. Hey! I guess that's the kind of things that I don't really like to discuss...~ 
@411= ~Yet there is not much to say. My adolescence was desperately banal, no family killed and no revenge to be taken, if that's what you wanted to hear. Not even cruel parents. We were a modest family, that's true, but I have always been well treated.~
@412= ~So, why take to the sea?~
@413= ~So why become a pirate?~
@414= ~Continue, I'm listening.~
@415= ~They are still alive?~
@416= ~Very touching. Well, let's go.~
@417= ~A little patience, <CHARNAME>. I know that I take a lot of time to tell things, but don't worry, everything will eventually be explained.~
@418= ~Yes... no... I think I don't know...~
@419= ~I always liked the handling of weapons. At an age when other girls play with dolls and learn basketry, I was running in the streets with the neighbourhood kids, replaying imaginary battles with big wooden swords... It was a good time! I only dreamed of one thing, learning to fight. And my parents have bled their veins to get me enrolled in the martial academy of Baldur's Gate. I was thirteen years old.~
@420= ~Hey. I think each person has different talents. Some know cooking, other easily remember the books they read, others play music like no one else. Me, my talent was fighting. At sixteen, I was one of the best blades of the Academy, and I was appointed sergeant in the guard of Baldur's Gate.~
@421= ~It's wonderful! A Sergeant at sixteen years! Your parents must have been proud!~
@422= ~Now I understand better why you fight so well. The Academy of Baldur's Gate is known for its swordsmen.~
@423= ~One of the best blades? Arrgh, their level was that low?~
@424= ~You were a guard? But then, why become a pirate?~
@425= ~I think I can imagine what happened then...~
@426= ~Great. Well, can we go now?~
@427= ~Oh, yes, they were proud! They told it to the entire neighbourhood! And myself, I was puffed up with pride at the idea of being chosen so quickly to be in command of a group. But as you can imagine, things didn't go as I had hoped...~
@428= ~I appreciate the compliment. Yes, it was a good academy. I think back to those times with nostalgia. The teachers were strict but fair, and they judged people on their abilities, not on their race or sex...~
@429= ~I take that for irony, and I won't cut out your tongue. But be careful anyway, this is something I am very sensitive about...~
@430= ~I'm sorry, I was just kidding; continue your story.~
@431= ~It's not my fault that you don't know how to fight. Sorry if the truth hurts.~
@432= ~Oh, let me tell you, <CHARNAME>, it certainly wasn't my decision. No...~
@433= ~Then you're more quick-witted than I, because at that time, I didn't suspect any trouble. No, I was at the height of joy! How stupid I was...~
@434= ~You, who made Baldur's Gate tremble, ask yourself if you ever saw a female guard in the city. The answer is no, of course. There are a few, but they are assigned to the barracks for all the domestic work. Hah! I've never seen more pathetic mindsets then when I joined this prestigious organization.~
@435= ~The pompous and hollow morons, all the same they were! Unable to understand that a woman not only could join them, but also command a patrol! It was inconceivable for their small degenerate primate brains.~
@436= ~... Excuse me, <CHARNAME>, I get angry, but not towards you. Simply, I get nervous tensions every time I look back at that period of my life. The daily contempt, bullying, insults, obscene proposals... I thought I could impose myself, but it was too hard, <CHARNAME>, too hard!~
@437= ~I... I'm sorry to hear that. Men are sometimes cruel.~
@438= ~If I had been in your place, I would have ripped out the heart of one of your torturers, just make the other think twice.~
@439= ~Bah, they made just innocent jokes, I am sure. You're too sensitive.~
@440= ~Charming story, but I'm a little bored. Let's go.~
@441= ~They were right to treat you like that. A woman with weapons? Ridiculous!~
@442= ~You have exceeded your limits, <CHARNAME>. I may be a mercenary, but I choose my employers. Burn in hell, I don't ever want to see your dirty face again!~
@443= ~Innocent jokes? I... these "jokes", as you say, destroyed my life. I would be glad if you could keep your sarcastic comments to yourself! You don't know what it means to be treated like I was! Ah, it is no good get angry like that. But the wounds are still so fresh...~
@444= ~Well... to tell the truth, that's close to what I did.~
@445= ~Bah. The more men I meet, the less I support their arrogant and contemptuous attitude. I'm not saying this to you, <CHARNAME>, but I hope that you begin to understand why I am suspicious of you. Anyway...~
@446= ~Bah! The more men I meet, the less I support their arrogant and contemptuous attitude. I don't know how you see men, <CHARNAME>, if they attract you or disgust you, but for me, it's the second one! And wait, it's not over...~
@447= ~One day, I couldn't support their continued bullying no longer. I drew my sword and they attacked me three against one. They had been waiting for it, to give me a lesson! But I was so angry that I killed all three. I think, that was not what they had planned...~
@448= ~Yet, the alarm was sounded, and a wanted notice with my name was issued. So I fled the city hiding, trying to reach a boat that sails to the open sea. But the arrest order had been spread, so all merchant ships were inaccessible for me. Desperate as I was, I went on board the pirate Greenbeard's ship, whom I told you about. There, my skills were finally being recognized.~
@449= ~Why did you flee? You were right to act as you did!~
@450= ~You were wrong, Kim. Whatever bullying, killing is never a solution.~
@451= ~But... and your parents? Did you abandon them?~
@452= ~That is a change of life a little... radical, no?~
@453= ~I thought that Greenbeard had tried to sleep with you?~
@454= ~I expected a crispier story, but you made me half asleep...~
@455= ~Thanks for your support, <CHARNAME>. You know that means a lot to me... but justice didn't have the same opinion. I was a wanted person for a long time, I don't know if I am still. No, I couldn't stay. And, more important, I didn't *want* to stay. Not after all that. I am a pirate now, and I have no regrets.~
@456= ~I don't need your moralizing speeches, thank you. I acted as I thought necessary, and would do the same again, if necessary. Never again will I be oppressed, simply because morons think that women should not fight. And I have no regrets. I am a pirate, now. There's no turning back.~
@457= ~I had no choice! Everyone knew who my parents were, I would have put them at risk by going to see them. Even now, after two years, I'm not sure it is a good idea, to visit the house... And yet I miss them so much! But I am a pirate, now. There's no way going back anymore.~
@458= ~Yes, but such is life. If the guards had a little more intelligence and sensitivity, I would always be on the side of the law, rather than wandering alongside a child of Bhaal, searching for <PRO_HISHER> past and future...~
@459= ~After a year, yes. But at first, he drew his sword and asked me to prove my value. He was strong, much stronger than me, but he was only defending himself, never taking advantage of any of my openings in my defence. After a few minutes, he began shaking his head and said that I had passed his test. You don't know how happy I was. A new life began for me! If I knew than, that later on his feelings would change so much...~
@460= ~Bah! Again, I speak, I speak, and we don't get any further. Sorry to have taken you so long, <CHARNAME>, but it was nice of you to show interest in my past. And, pirate or not, I'm happy to be in your group.~
@461= ~Hey, it's been a long time since I had asked you a philosophical question! Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what is your purpose in life? What do you want more than anything?~ [Kim]
@462= ~Power and authority.~
@463= ~Gold and fortune.~
@464= ~Fame and glory.~
@465= ~Camaraderie and friendship.~
@466= ~Love!~
@467= ~A united family.~
@468= ~Tranquillity and peace.~
@469= ~To be able to improve people's lives.~
@470= ~More than anything else, I want my peace. Leave me alone, Kim!~
@471= ~Pffft... Worse than a dog!~
@472= ~Improving people's lives? Do you see that! So your most cherished desire is to continue to wander as you do, never to stop giving a hand to others? "No problem, I will find your son!", "Don't worry, I'll help you kill the ogres!", "Of course, I will investigate this murder!" Bah, I can't understand what pleasure you can get from that...~
@473= ~Yes, I can understand why you want it right now, while you have no time for yourself... but are you able to resist the call of adventure? Are you ready to spend many quiet days in a house in the countryside, without ever getting bored?~
@474= ~A family? That would be nice, wouldn't it, <CHARNAME>? Being able to spend your life with a wife and noisy children, and to smile watching them slowly grow... Yes, that is an interesting choice.~
@475= ~A family? That would be nice, wouldn't it, <CHARNAME>? Being able to spend your life with a man and noisy children, and to smile watching them slowly grow... Yes, that is an interesting choice.~
@476= ~Hey... say no more, <CHARNAME>, you make me cry. Love! How beautiful and noble and romantic! Well, you just need to find yourself a woman who matches you. I wonder if you already have an idea...~
@477= ~Hey... you are so right, <CHARNAME>... Love! How beautiful and noble and romantic! It would be nice if we could find the perfect men we dream about, while we are travelling. I wonder if you already have an idea...~
@478= ~Of course, you're right, <CHARNAME>, that is certainly an important part of our lives. I understand you may wish to seek real friends, ready to support you in difficult times, and for whom we would risk our lives... But if I can reassure you, I think you're on the right track!~
@479= ~Oh, yes, I perfectly understand you! There will always be those, who say it is a pittance, and that glory has never fed anyone, but I am convinced that it is a goal worth reaching. But you must decide what means are used to achieve it, and whether it is going to be fame or infamy...~
@480= ~Gold? Bah, your dreams are rather boring, <CHARNAME>. Gold is not worth much, in the end. Look at us, in a few days of adventure, we have already raised the wealth of several kings. Gold comes and leaves. Do you really think it will bring you what you are dreaming about?~
@481= ~Hey. I guess you're not the only who dreams of such things, <CHARNAME>. But unlike others, you have the means to achieve your ambitions. As a child of Bhaal, I have no doubt that, in the end, you will sooner or later obtain the power you're looking for...~
@482= ~Nevertheless, it's an interesting response. You're full of surprises, <CHARNAME>. Personally, it is glory that I would like to find. A kind of revenge, on all people who have sought to humiliate me. I want to show them that I have become somebody!~
@483= ~It's very immature, isn't it? This desire to show the world what I am capable of?~
@484= ~Yes, a little, but I guess it's a normal desire given what you have experienced.~
@485= ~Yes, a little, but I like this immature side, in your case...~
@486= ~Yes, a little, it betrays a certain lack of self-confidence, don't you think?~
@487= ~Not at all, seeking glory is quite normal!~
@488= ~Not at all, trying to show them your real value is quite normal!~
@489= ~I answered your stupid question, isn't that good enough for you?~
@490= ~Hey, I don't know if we are both right or both wrong, but it's a pleasure to be of the same opinion, once... although, from time to time, I wonder if this obsession isn't a bit unhealthy. Ah, but what do you want, my destiny is already set...~
@491= ~Looking for glory? I don't know. But to prove your value, yes. Ah, but what do you want! Whether I want it or not, my destiny is already set...~
@492= ~You are certainly right. Sometimes when I have time to reflect, I wonder if the guards at the Baldur's Gate weren't right, if a woman like me can really succeed in tracing her destiny at the tip of her sword. But I think we will soon have the answer! My destiny is already set...~
@493= ~Hey, that's nice, <CHARNAME>. Am I dreaming, or did you give me a compliment? Anyway, it's good to have your support when I begin to doubt. Anyway, my destiny is already set...~
@494= ~You're right. I may well tell myself that it is stupid, but should I just see the faces of those cursed guards again, my anger will be back like on the first day. Hey, I wonder how they will react when they hear about me. Because, for better or for worse, my destiny is already set...~
@495= ~By agreeing to travel with you, I started to write my own legend alongside yours. Killing Irenicus won't be a small achievement, and I've got a feeling that it won't stop there. You challenge fate, <CHARNAME>. On your side, glory is ensured!~
@496= ~Hey, don't look at me so curiously. That is not the *only* reason for my presence in your group!~
@497= ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, can I speak to you for two minutes?~ [Kim]
@498= ~Of course!~
@499= ~No, you getting me tired in advance.~
@500= ~Two minutes? Your stories are usually longer...~
@501= ~Far from me to exhaust you, <CHARNAME>.~
@502= ~Hey, so to speak, of course. You know very well that I won't be quiet so soon! But I'll take your comment as an agreement. So, get ready, I begin my story!~
@503= ~In fact, I was thinking about all these adventures that we live through. Piracy is a dangerous activity, as you know no doubt, yet I have never fought as much, I have never seen so many monsters since we travel together.~
@504= ~I mean, when I was fighting in the past, I knew who the enemy was and I knew that I would die should he happen to be more skilled with the sword than I... But now, death can strike anywhere! We meet monsters with strange powers, illithids, dragons, lycanthropes, vampires, beholders, and what else? You might be a divine child, but I am human... sometimes I feel so...~
@505= ~... lost?~
@506= ~... desperate?~
@507= ~... tired?~
@508= ~... overwhelmed by the events?~
@509= ~... powerless?~
@510= ~... weak?~
@511= ~... useless?~
@512= ~Yes, you could say it like that. I feel a little lost. Asking myself what my role is in this whole adventure... It starts taking enormous magnitudes!~
@513= ~Not really desperate, but sometimes a little disillusioned, yes. The more we move forward, the more things stay the same. The monsters become increasingly powerful, as do we, and the massacre continues...~
@514= ~Perhaps a little tired, yes. The more we move forward, the more things stay the same. The monsters become increasingly powerful, as do we, and the massacre continues...~
@515= ~Exactly! It's the expression that I was looking for! All this is so... if... and I feel... aaah, I can't find the words! The more we move forward, the more things stay the same. The monsters become increasingly powerful, as do we, and the massacre continues...~
@516= ~Not really powerless, after all. I hope that my talents have been useful to you in your quest! No, not powerless, but perhaps a little overwhelmed. The more we move forward, the more things stay the same. The monsters become increasingly powerful, as do we, and the massacre continues...~
@517= ~Weak? Who do you think you are? No, I don't feel weak! Actually, I think I have progressed quite a lot since we met. I'm stronger than ever before! It is just that... the more we move forward, the more things stay the same. The monsters become increasingly powerful, as do we, and the massacre continues...~
@518= ~Hmpff... it's so nice to feel so appreciated. No thank you, <CHARNAME>, I don't feel particularly useless. It is just that... the more we move forward, the more things stay the same. The monsters become increasingly powerful, as do we, and the massacre continues...~
@519= ~I mean, I'm but a pirate! A simple pirate! I know how to fight, certainly, but I have no special power, no particular ability, anything that makes me extraordinary! So far, the only monsters that I encountered were some marauding goblins, and one or two tritons that had attacked our ship...~
@520= ~Oh, I do not know what I want to tell you... it's just that sometimes I wonder if it is reasonable to continue following you. All those that you appreciate seem to suffer, and your enemies are innumerable. One day, I too will succumb to the petrifying ray of a beholder, if this isn't a demilich who imprisons me.~
@521= ~What do you think, <CHARNAME>? Is it a good idea to continue to journey alongside you? Or am I lacking the necessary experience, am I deluding myself in illusions?~
@522= ~You are wonderful, Kim. Don't question yourself like that. I don't know what I would do without you...~
@523= ~You're a great thief, Kim. Don't question yourself like that. I don't know what I would do without your talents...~
@524= ~You know you're rather cute, when you falter like that?~
@525= ~We all have our moments of doubt, Kim. Don't worry, it will pass.~
@526= ~This is a question that only you can answer. If you want to leave, it is your right.~
@527= ~Yes, go away, it will give me a holiday!~
@528= ~... It's been days that we travel together, and that is how you treat me? Yes, you're right, I'd better leave. Goodbye, miserable son of a bitch!~
@529= ~Hey... always so neutral, yes, <CHARNAME>? But you're right, it's up to me to make a decision. And it's already been taken: I remain at your side, whatever happens. And one day, I, the little pirate, I will end up beheading tan'aari with only one slash. Hey, it promises to be interesting...~
@530= ~From the beginning, you treated me like a cheap whore, <CHARNAME>. I believe my decision is actually taken. I will let you face your destiny alone. Goodbye and good luck.~
@531= ~Yes... I guess you're right...~
@532= ~Hey! Thank you, <CHARNAME>. It's a somewhat unexpected compliment, but I must say that it lifts my spirits at the right time!~
@533= ~Hmpff... yes, I suppose you could hardly find another thief stupid enough to engage in such an adventure with you. But is that the only reason I'm useful to you? Disarming traps that are in the way of the glorious child of Bhaal?~
@534= ~Wonderful, me? Hmm, I must say that sounds good. Hey, don't flatter me, <CHARNAME>, I might like the taste of it!~
@535= ~There is not much else to say, is there? I suppose, Kim, the little pirate, will have to hold onto it and evolve a bit, to become... a little more than a pirate. I must say that the prospect frightens me... but I have no choice, and my place is at your side.~
@536= ~Irenicus, demons, vampires and Bhaal supporters of all kinds, you will regret you dared to attack <CHARNAME>! Because Kim is at <PRO_HISHER> side, ready to defend <PRO_HIMHER>! Mwhaahahaha!~
@537= ~*ahem*~
@538= ~That sounded good? Was it convincing?~
@539= ~Perfect, Kim! I am proud to have you with me!~
@540= ~Uh... yes, yes, of course!~
@541= ~It sounded like a turtle having an asthmatic attack...~
@542= ~Oh... I see. I made an effort, nevertheless...~
@543= ~I see. Anyway, the bottom line is that I have convinced myself, huh? Come on, let's get back on our way.~
@544= ~Hey, your enthusiasm is a pleasure to see. Irenicus, beware...~
@545= ~Hmm, <CHARNAME>, don't get me wrong, but I have an important question to ask...~ [kim]
@546= ~Well, it's beem some time that we travel together, trying to discover what this Irenicus wants from you. But if I understand what you told me, he is extremely powerful. I just have to look at the damage he made near Waukeen's Promenade to understand that this is not just anybody. He captured you once, and he is clearly ready to do it again.~
@547= ~So I was wondering... what will you do when you finally find him? Is it really a good idea to go and annoy him? Isn't he going to capture you again?~
@548= ~If I'm not going to look for him, he will still end up finding me...~
@549= ~You forget about Imoen a little too quickly. I can't leave her in his hands!~
@550= ~Those who attack me always end up regretting it, one day or another.~
@551= ~You're right. I should drop everything right now!~
@552= ~Irenicus took me by surprise. Next time, he will die.~
@553= ~I am a child of Bhaal, Kim. I'm only following my destiny.~
@554= ~You're a coward and a weakling, Kim. How dare you suggest that?~
@555= ~See that! I thought it was a legitimate question, but if you're too stupid to answer...~
@556= ~Tsss. You should be the master of your destiny, not the opposite. It's so easy to impute all your actions as consequences of a dark prophecy or a dangerous ancestry...~
@557= ~It's good to have confidence in yourself, but are you really sure of that, or is it your pride that speaks? I don't know how powerful this Irenicus might be, but even the Cowled Wizards had difficulties stopping him, while he was alone, and there were many of them...~
@558= ~Uh? I didn't really think you'd say that, <CHARNAME>. I hope you are kidding! I wanted to tease you a bit, and make you talk about the strategies you might use. I didn't want to completely dishearten you!~
@559= ~Yes, you're right, of course. I understand that this girl is very important to you. But that shouldn't prevent you from considering in advance, what you will do when you're facing him.~
@560= ~Hmm... that isn't wrong. But if he is so powerful, then perhaps he is aware that you are hunting him at this moment? It might be possible that you are walking into an ambush! I don't know, in your place, I wouldn't be so calm...~
@561= ~Anyway, do you have a strategy in mind should you find him? An idea how to fight him? Don't hesitate to share your thoughts about that with me, perhaps I can help you or give you some advice.~
@562= ~Fighters directly attack him, magicians use any opening in his defence, clerics heal the wounded. Nothing but the classic strategy.~
@563= ~Lots of invocations to exhaust his spells, then general assault!~
@564= ~Hmm... I propose to tickle him to death!~
@565= ~No, I have no plan. I'm trusting my abilities.~
@566= ~No, I have no plan. I have trust in this group. Together we shall defeat him.~
@567= ~I must say that I have no idea how I will fight him...~
@568= ~Advice? From you? Don't make me laugh!~
@569= ~Hey, you're really careless! I hope you know what you're doing. Irenicus seems too dangerous to me to be taken lightly. Hmm, my blood boils at the idea of facing him!~
@570= ~Hey, I like your answer. He is too powerful to be killed by you alone, but all together, I suppose it becomes feasible. Just try not to depend too much on us! It's you he wants, and it's you he will try to kill or capture...~
@571= ~This is very arrogant of you. In my humble opinion, you should try to have more consideration for us. Alone, you will never succeed. With your party, you might stand a chance. Hmm, my blood boils at the idea of facing him!~
@572= ~Hey! Good idea! Now I am reassured, you do have a plan, after all. And then, I don't know any spell of "protection against tickling". Maybe you found the ultimate weapon, who knows? In any case, I am convinced that he doesn't expect this strategy...~
@573= ~Mmpff. Why not, that's the kind of tactic that always works well. But if I were in the place of that Ireni...thing, I'd cast a little spell of death and, pop, all your summoned creatures disappear. Yes, yes, even your big demons! No, I'm not sure it is a good idea to base your strategy on that one...~
@574= ~It seems logical, but in my opinion, it will not be so simple. Such a powerful wizard will probably have placed spells traps to close those openings. And time stops to disrupt everything. Hmm, my blood boils at the idea of facing him!~
@575= ~Anyway, I hope you will have found a strategy by the time we will have found him. I am confident about your great talent as a tactician!~
@576= ~I thought about our last discussion we had on Irenicus, <CHARNAME>, and I told myself that if we wanted to increase our chances of defeating him, we would need to find powerful and legendary objects, that would help us in our adventures.~ [kim]
@577= ~I've heard of many such objects when I was a pirate. We travel a lot, and we come to hear all the legends. Oh, I'm not saying they're all true, but they nevertheless will have a grain of truth; do you want me to tell you about them?~
@578= ~Sure. You know that I am always eager to listen when someone talks about powerful objects...~
@579= ~Sure. You know that I am always eager to listen to you, whatever you say!~
@580= ~I think we are already sufficiently powerful right now, Kim.~
@581= ~Legends! Tales! Quit dreaming and walk, kid!~
@582= ~Oh, very well, very well...~
@583= ~Yes, you're probably right. Sorry to have bothered, in that case.~
@584= ~Hey, that's so nice! I don't know if it's ironic, but it's still very nice. Right then!~
@585= ~I heard of a ring, a katana, a two-handed sword, a club, a staff, a robe, an amulet and of a cape. What legend would you like to hear?~
@586= ~About the ring~
@587= ~About the katana~
@588= ~About the two-handed sword~
@589= ~About the club~
@590= ~About the staff~
@591= ~About the robe~
@592= ~About the amulet~
@593= ~About the cape~
@594= ~I see. Thank you for your stories, Kim.~
@595= ~This is one of the most persistent legends that I have heard. It seems that a miraculous cape, capable of repelling the most powerful spells, was lost at sea many years ago. A sailor is said to have seen fish-men get hold of it. You know, the ones that are called Sahuagin. But I guess we will never find such an artifact, but just imagine its effectiveness against that Irenicus of yours!~
@596= ~Ah, I'm sure it's a legend that you don't know, because it concerns Greenbeard directly! You know, I have told you about his almost total invulnerability against weapons? Well, it would seem that, at least in part, this is due to the power of the amulet that never leaves his neck. It would be nice to have such an object, huh, <CHARNAME>? No longer having to fear swords or arrows! Still, first we would have to find Greenbeard, and I don't really want that to happen...~
@597= ~On our ship, there was word about the legendary power of the robe of Vecna. This robe enables its wearer to cast spells much faster, and also protects the magician as if he was wearing chain mail! The last time we heard about it, it was said a dealer in Athkatla had recovered it, perhaps we could buy it?~
@598= ~Hey, this is one of the wildest stories that I was told! Just try to imagine that there was a monstrous organisation in Athkatla, the Stuck Rune, or Broken Rune, anyway, a ridiculous name like that, and it would be the holder of one of the most powerful staffs ever conceived: the Staff of the Magi. Hey, if only it could be true!~
@599= ~Ah, that is an object that would be useful for us against undead creatures. This legend, I've been told it directly by Renald. He explained that if I ever found a mace of disruption, adding pure illithium to it would make it much more powerful. If only we could find these ingredients, our problems would be much facilitated, don't you believe?~
@600= ~Bah, an object for a paladin, but probably one of the most powerful weapons if what I heard is true. It seems that Carsomyr, the legendary holy sword, has been hidden for centuries among the treasures of a big dragon. But where, that is the mystery. Anyway, I'm not into those tin cans!~
@601= ~Here in Athkatla, I've heard the story of a magic katana that could stun all the enemies it hits. It seems incredible, but the one who told me about it, sounded very convinced. He said he had seen inhuman warriors use it against thieves in the temple district. I don't know if we will find something, but it might be worthwhile to have a look there one day, right?~
@602= ~I think you're not going to believe my story. A crewman of Greenbeard, whom I asked why he had become a pirate, told me he wanted to flee from Athkatla most of all! He said that while walking near the thieves' guild, by chance he had run into an entity which proposed him a deal: a ring for the recovery of parts of its buried body. The pirate said he had accepted, but the parts were guarded by liches, and now they haunt his nights. Oh, I had to kill him eventually as he became totally crazy. A nasty story, but one that we should look into, don't you believe?~
@603= ~It's a pleasure to educate you, <CHARNAME>. Ha!~
@604= ~I would like to ask you a question, <CHARNAME>, that might sound a little odd...~ [Kim]
@605= ~We fight a lot recently and I see how you fight and kill. But what do you feel when the fighting ends and the bodies are lying at your feet? Sometimes, they are monsters, but sometimes they are <PRO_RACE>s, like you, who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. So what do you feel? Pleasure? Disgust?~
@606= ~Pleasure, of course. The pleasure of domination and destruction!~
@607= ~Pleasure, the pleasure given by the impression of having surpassed oneself and by the victory against ones enemies.~
@608= ~Pleasure, the one of having survived when someone was trying to kill me.~
@609= ~A mix of both, I suppose. Pleased at having survived, sadness at having killed...~
@610= ~Indifference. I have a mission to accomplish, those who stand in my way will die.~
@611= ~Indifference. It is not me who attacks them, but they who attack me. They chose their destiny.~
@612= ~Disgust. If only there could be another way!~
@613= ~In any case, I can tell you, you are disgusting me.~
@614= ~I disgust you? Really? Well, if it is so, I will not disgust you any longer. Goodbye, <CHARNAME> and may the sharks eat your heart!~
@615= ~Yes, I suppose it is a logical feeling. These killings that never stop should nauseate even the most toughened warrior; yet...~
@616= ~That's what I tell myself too <CHARNAME>, but perhaps they are dead because of *your* destiny?~
@617= ~Hmm... and you think your mission is more important than the lives of those few? Maybe you're not wrong, maybe the essence of Bhaal leaves you no other choice, but I thought you would have more scruples...~
@618= ~Hey, that's what I feel, too. You never feel more alive than after a tough fight, don't you? But sometimes I wonder about the lives that I destroyed, about the children and families those people may have had...~
@619= ~Yes, that’s what it's all about, isn't it? Win or lose, live or die, move forward or backward. But, don't you sometimes ask yourself if it's worth it? If there is any reason for all these deaths?~
@620= ~Yes, I can certainly understand the exhilaration of combat, the pleasure of all your senses when you jump into the heart of the battle... but even I am beginning to get tired of this perpetual violence.~
@621= ~Hmpff... That's the essence of Bhaal speaking out of you. That's what leads you to destruction and domination, isn't it? Was it you who responded, or the essence? How could I know?~
@622= ~All your troubles seem to be caused, in one way or another, by this essence you carry inside. Tell me, <CHARNAME>, and please answer me honestly...~
@623= ~If you could give up all of it, all these stories of prophecy, abandon your divine essence, would you do it?~
@624= ~Without hesitation or even looking back!~
@625= ~With regret, but for the good of Faerûn.~
@626= ~No, I need this essence and its power to protect those I love!~
@627= ~No way! My power now is nothing compared to that I'll reach one day!~
@628= ~No. My destiny is that of a god, whether I like it or not.~
@629= ~The essence of Bhaal is part of me. I would no longer be the same without it.~
@630= ~I... I guess you're right. I wonder what kind of personality you could have developed, if you didn't have such a terrible father; if you hadn't been forced to leave Candlekeep, to see your foster father being killed before your eyes...~
@631= ~What stupid fatalism! You can always do something about it, if you really want to! Fate, bah! That's a laughable concept invented by the weak to justify their cowardice. No, <CHARNAME>, that kind of answer is unworthy of you.~
@632= ~Hmm... uh, alright... I can't say that you're wrong. Me too, I think I would be happy to have such powers... and yet I am disappointed by your answer. I don't know why...~
@633= ~Ah, but maybe if you didn't have that essence, you wouldn't *need* to protect your loved ones. Have you ever thought about that? Maybe your life would have been much happier if you've never had heard of this story of gods...~
@634= ~For the good? Pah, do you sometimes think about what you say, or is it your passion for justice that blinds you to the point, where you don't recognize what stupidities you are saying? Who spoke of Faerûn? I'm talking about you, about you and your wishes! And if you tell me that your happiness is linked to the happiness of the world, I... I'll strangle you!~
@635= ~Really? Without a single look back? You would turn your back on everything that you've experienced so far, with a simple snap? And what would you do then? Who would you become? Would you be able to settle for a normal life?~
@636= ~However, I must say I'm happy about one thing at least...~
@637= ~No... nothing... you wouldn't understand.~
@638= ~If you didn't have your divine essence, you would never have been kidnapped by Irenicus, and you would probably never have come to Athkatla... and I would never have been able to meet you. Finally, I'm kind of happy that happened...~
@639= ~Are you ready for another of my philosophical questions, <CHARNAME>?~ [kim]
@640= ~Of course, I'm always looking forward to them!~
@641= ~I'm listening, what would you like to ask?~
@642= ~Ready, ready, it's said so quickly... but go ahead anyway.~
@643= ~You're a *pirate*, Kim. Leave the intellectual debates to others.~
@644= ~Uhh... I think you're not qualified to talk to me like that...~
@645= ~Hey, don't get excited like that, it's bad for your heart. You'll see, my question is very simple.~
@646= ~Well, as I told you, it's quite... philosophical. But I was wondering if you believed in... fate. In an impalpable and absolute force that leads the lives of men?~
@647= ~You want to talk about the gods?~
@648= ~Yes. I am convinced that a higher power directs all our actions.~
@649= ~I think some, like me, have a destiny to accomplish that they can't deviate from.~
@650= ~I think there is a higher power that weaves the fate of the world, but any of us may choose his place in this great destiny.~
@651= ~I think it is our actions that shape our lives, and not any outside power.~
@652= ~I think destiny is an invention of puny cowards to explain their mistakes.~
@653= ~Bah... What a stupid question!~
@654= ~Bravo, well said! I totally agree with you, <CHARNAME>. It irritates me to hear people talk about destiny when it is generally nothing but cowardice. Anyone can escape his destiny... even you!~
@655= ~An interesting idea... A large generalized destiny, but where everyone would have his free will? It seems a little far-fetched, but I will think about it. In any case, it's already an improvement over those who believe, that everything they do is written in the stars...~
@656= ~Some, but not all, huh? You know, I've always been frank with you, so let me tell you that this is the most ridiculous theory I have ever heard from you. So, some people would not be able to change the course of events, they would be guided by another power? Well, that's pathetic if it is true, and it is even more so, if you made up those ideas in your head.~
@657= ~Well, that is a speech that doesn't appeal to me. So, you would not be free of your actions? Everything you do would be directed by some kind of power? Doesn't that seem disgusting to you? What good is it to live, if it was that way?~
@658= ~No, not exactly gods... but a power that leads them too. Something you can't grasp, yet very real, and that directs our lives?~
@659= ~No, I don't believe in destiny. I believe in the importance of actions, causes and consequences. It isn't destiny why you are here. It's the consequence of your divine blood, of the ambitions of Sarevok, of those of Irenicus, and of many other factors that have lead to your quest.~
@660= ~But isn't that precisely what destiny is about? This avalanche of causes leading to a consequence?~
@661= ~Yes, I think you're quite right.~
@662= ~You do as you please. Myself, I believe in it.~
@663= ~And what about the prophecies of Alaundo, then? And the prophecies in general? How could they exist if the future was not already written?~
@664= ~I think your destiny is to shut up!~
@665= ~Hey, that is a good question... and I must say that I don't know the answer. But it is true, that this is something that troubles me greatly. Perhaps their magic, so powerful, allows them to influence events once the prophecy is delivered, or perhaps it is something else. Nevertheless, the fact that Alaundo has made a prophecy that seems to concern you is meaningless. Don't let yourself be directed, <CHARNAME>!~
@666= ~Well, that ends the discussion, I suppose. But a last word before closing it for good...~
@667= ~And .. that's all? Well, I hoped for a more lively debate! But I am glad that we have the same opinion.~
@668= ~Hey, that is a good point, although I expected it already. Yes, perhaps fate is this series of coincidences, meetings and events. Maybe the events that made that I am part of your group - your capture, my sinking, our work for Renald - can be considered as part of some sort of destiny. However, that doesn't change anything of what I wanted to tell you.~
@669= ~For me, destiny doesn't exist, which means that I am not bound by any *mystical* chain to you and to your quest, <CHARNAME>. My decision, I take it with the best of my knowledge and belief, and I am judging your actions, rather than what you are supposed to represent.~
@670= ~I... I don't really feel like following you any longer. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. You probably have a miraculous power inside you, but as time passes, I feel more and more that we don't understand each other. I think it's better that I leave. Hey, I'll even give you your gold back, so you don't regret my departure too much.~
@671= ~It's better like that... isn't it? Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@672= ~I think my place is at your side. Gold is not everything in this world - Ha, although I have never been richer than that since we travel together! I don't believe in all these stories of destiny, but I know that you have powerful enemies to face, exhausting combats to fight, and I think I can help you with it.~
@673= ~From now on, my sword belongs to you. Use it wisely... don't do too many silly things, yes?~
@674= ~(Kim smiles and retakes her place in the group. The decision has been difficult to make for the young pirate, but a sense of peace can be read on her face. Despite all her speeches on free choice, she has chosen... her destiny today.)~
@675= ~What... ouch!~ [kim2]
@676= ~(You turn back as you hear the noise of a boot crushing a rotten fruit, just in time to see Kim desperately trying to regain her balance, then collapsing on the floor.)~
@677= ~Kim! Are you alright?~
@678= ~(Laugh out loud)~
@679= ~What have you done again?~
@680= ~For a pirate, you singularly lack balance...~
@681= ~Hey! Defeated by a simple fruit... a sad fate for a swashbuckler! (She tries to stand and her good humour disappears)~
@682= ~What do you think I *have* done, huh? I slipped on a fruit and I fell. It happens to everyone! And I forbid you to laugh! (She pokes her tongue at you, then tries to rise. Immediately, a flash of pain passes through her eyes)~
@683= ~Well, except for the fact that I slipped on a rotten apple, that my dress is probably irrecoverable, and that I've got bruises everywhere, I guess you can say that I'm alright, yes... (She tries to stand... and her good humour disappears suddenly)~
@684= ~I... I can't get up! My left leg seems... (A cry of pain escapes her when she tries to bend her knee) Ouch! I think I sprained something...~
@685= ~Give me your hand, I'll help you get up.~
@686= ~Try not to move, I will massage your leg.~
@687= ~(Inspect her leg)~
@688= ~That seems to be serious. Oh, oh, we will have to amputate!~
@689= ~See how you get up yourself. You're holding us back.~
@690= ~(Her eyes suddenly burn with anger. In a supreme effort, she manages to get up by holding onto her other leg. A drop of sweat appears on her forehead, but she grits her teeth without saying anything. Her voice is frigid when she speaks to you) This episode is over. Let's go.~
@691= ~Hey. It's easy to make fun if it isn't you who is lying on the floor, huh? (She shrugs, biting her teeth to fight the pain) Don't worry about me, this will pass.~
@692= ~(You gently touch Kim's thigh, then frown. It is probably a sprained muscle. Nothing really serious, but you doubt she can get up if you don't help her.)~
@693= ~You? Massage me? You're trying to profit from the situation, right? (Her eyes narrow) It's alright, I'll manage to get up alone, don't worry... and without massage.~
@694= ~Don't be stupid, and give me your hand, I'll help you!~
@695= ~I assure you that it will help you. Honestly.~
@696= ~It's a muscle that is a little sprained, that's all. Let me relax you...~
@697= ~I trust you. Be courageous, Kim, get up!~
@698= ~Very well, then get up. You hold us back.~
@699= ~(She looks at your arm as if it was a poisonous snake and then, after a tiny hesitation, grabs it. Her hand feels soft and cool in yours) Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@700= ~(Gently lift Kim, before releasing her hand)~
@701= ~(Gently lift Kim, without releasing her hand)~
@702= ~(Gently lift Kim and take her in your arms)~
@703= ~(Let Kim drop)~
@704= ~(She hesitates a moment, as if she had expected something else. Finally, she sighs and grits her teeth. Pushing on her hand, she manages to get up with some difficulties) This episode is over. Let's get back on our way.~
@705= ~I told you no! How many times do I have to repeat it to you? (She grits her teeth out of frustration, and at the price of an extraordinary effort, manages to get up). This episode is over. Let's get back on our way.~
@706= ~(Without your support, Kim slips back and collapses again. She screams from pain taking hold of her injured leg.)~
@707= ~Thank you very much... I really have no luck! What was the likelihood of... Hey! What...? Who do you think you are? How dare you take advantage of the situation?~
@708= ~Thank you very much... I really have no luck! What was the probability of finding a rotten fruit here? Aaah, well... (She seems suddenly to realize that you didn't let go her hand and she's confused for a second, before freeing herself. Her fingers slightly touch your palm) I... I think it's time to go, <CHARNAME>.~
@709= ~Wait, you're limping. You should hold on to me.~
@710= ~Wait, you're limping. I'll carry you.~
@711= ~Wait, you're limping. I will ask someone to cast a healing spell.~
@712= ~You're right, let's go.~
@713= ~Thank you very much... Hey, I really have no luck! What was the probability of finding a rotten fruit here? Finally, what do you want to... I... I think it's time to go, <CHARNAME>.~
@714= ~(Despite your reflexes trained by years of combat and adventure, you happen to be unable to avoid her vengeful slap. She turns her angry eyes toward you) Let me limp peacefully and don't ever get near me with your dirty hands again!~
@715= ~Don't bother... it's already getting better. But... (She smiles at you) it's nice that you care for me. Hey, just like my mother! Ah, well, I'm not sure you appreciate that comparison...~
@716= ~It is time to go, I think.~
@717= ~*Carry* me? Hey, do you think I'm going to let myself be carried like a common bag of potatoes? No, no, thank you. The pain is already starting to disappear. Let's get back on the road.~
@718= ~(She hesitates a moment, then finally accept the shoulder you offer her. She holds your arm tightly, and you get back on the road supporting her) Thank you, <CHARNAME>. This was not necessary, but it's rather nice of you...~
@719= ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, have you ever been told that you were rather cute?~ [Kim2]
@720= ~Physically speaking, I mean?~
@721= ~Yes, very often.~
@722= ~Yes, that did happen.~
@723= ~I admit that I don't remember...~
@724= ~Of course! I was already told that I have an athletic body and a divine face...~
@725= ~No, never.~
@726= ~That is a rather indiscreet question, isn't it?~
@727= ~I'm tired of listening to your babbling without interest.~
@728= ~How dare you? And I was giving you a sincere compliment! Very well, I won't bother you anymore.~
@729= ~Hey! I never thought to see <CHARNAME> blushing like a young virgin... That was not a question, stupid, it was an affirmation!~
@730= ~Never, uh? Well, it must have been a sad life for you, right? Hey, what do you want me to tell you, nature knows all tastes.~
@731= ~People were laughing about you very often, huh? Ah, don't worry, I'm just teasing you...~
@732= ~No? Usually, that is the kind of things that men remember. You are strange, <CHARNAME>. Unless this is a roundabout way to admit that you have never been told so? Ha!~
@733= ~Well, it doesn't matter to me, why should I remember?~
@734= ~You're right, it never happened...~
@735= ~I guess so. After all, who would remain indifferent in face of such a male presence? Ha!~
@736= ~Well, what arrogance! Don't you see the big pimple next to your nose? And your hair is greasy! And you squint a little. You really want to make me believe that you are constantly courted? Hey, I'm kidding...~
@737= ~I see. Well, I suppose if it doesn't matter to you, it's not worth talking any longer about that subject.~
@738= ~Anyway, the more I look at you, the more I think to myself there must be something. Oh, it certainly isn't a typical kind of beauty, but I understand that one can appreciate your physique, <CHARNAME>.~
@739= ~Hmm... was that a compliment?~
@740= ~Uh... thank you... I think!~
@741= ~I knew you would be captivated by my demonic charm! Mwhahaha!~
@742= ~And you certainly don't have a typical humour, but I understand that one can appreciate it, Kim...~
@743= ~And you, you're ugly and you're boring me. Go away!~
@744= ~Hah! Well said! Cute *and* funny? But tell me, you almost happen to be my male ideal, <CHARNAME>.~
@745= ~Uh... certainly, certainly... but if you start talking about puss moths, I warn you that I won't listen any longer!~
@746= ~Yes, yes, the nose is a little too long, the eyes are a little too distant, the hair is styled strangely, but I must confess that, in the end, the result is nice-looking.~
@747= ~Well, I decided to make you a compliment... that's done. I hope you enjoyed it. Your turn, now!~
@748= ~Huh?~
@749= ~Do you have to be told everything? I've complimented you, now it's your turn. You won't let a girl have the last word after all, that would be very rude...~
@750= ~Hmm... you look beautiful!~
@751= ~Hmm... you are very intelligent!~
@752= ~Hmm... you are very funny!~
@753= ~Hmm... I love your ears!~
@754= ~Hmm... I love your eyes!~
@755= ~Hmm... I feel good with you!~
@756= ~Hmm... you are very useful to our group!~
@757= ~Hmm... uh... ah...~
@758= ~Me? Make you a compliment? Go get your excitement from somebody else, kiddo!~
@759= ~Up to that point? Hey, I guess that's still the best compliment you can make me, remaining speechless in front of with my intelligence, my beauty and... my modesty!~
@760= ~Useful to the group, really? I... I thought you would make a more personal compliment, but I assume that I'll have to be happy with that one. Okay, let's get back on our way, then. I will try to be, hmm, useful...~
@761= ~....~
@762= ~...~
@763= ~You know, that is probably the greatest compliment that I have ever been made by anyone? Ahem... thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@764= ~Oh yeah? My eyes? Ah, I see, and why is that?~
@765= ~Because they are beautiful!~
@766= ~Because they shine with intelligence!~
@767= ~Because they are very expressive!~
@768= ~Because they are the mirror of your soul and your soul is beautiful...~
@769= ~Uh... my ears? But of course... Hey, you really have a completely stupid humour, <CHARNAME>. But I admit that I like that!~
@770= ~Hmpfff... usually, that is said when you can't find any other qualities, huh? Anyway, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt because you're right: I am *very * funny! Ha...~
@771= ~Intelligent? Hey, thank you, <CHARNAME>! That's not necessarily the kind of compliment which I expected, but I find it rather nice. When I think about it, it's true that I am incredibly intelligent. It awes you, huh? Haha...~
@772= ~Superb. Very original. You found that one alone? Hmpfff... you're lacking a little imagination, you know?~
@773= ~Anyway, my compliment to you was sincere. I don't know if it's the lights or something else, but honestly, you're not bad looking at all...~
@774= ~But that is no reason to get haughty, huh?~
@775= ~*Arrghk*. How horrible! How dare you come up with something as foreseeable and mediocre? You disappoint me, <CHARNAME>. Leave poetry to the poets, you don't succeed at it...~
@776= ~Mmmhh... not bad, as a compliment. I was a bit worried when you spoke of my eyes, I thought you were going to tell me something basic and conventional, but you've got the turn. Bravo, <CHARNAME>, you're above average! Haha...~
@777= ~I... I know this is ridiculous, but I miss my parents a lot. Would... would you have two minutes to speak about this with me, <CHARNAME>?~ [kim2]
@778= ~Always for you, Kim.~
@779= ~I'm listening.~
@780= ~The pirate falls into sentimentality? What horror!~
@781= ~I... how can you be so insensitive? I've misjudged you, <CHARNAME>. It doesn't matter, I won't make the same mistake again.~
@782= ~I know it may seem ridiculous for someone who gives herself airs like I do, but I must confess that I find it difficult to accept that I had to leave my family in a hurry during the incident in Baldur's Gate. I didn't even have the time to say goodbye. They are probably convinced that I am dead now...~
@783= ~I feel so alone <CHARNAME>, so sad. I didn't think I was a family woman, but it is when I lost them that I realized how much they meant to me...~
@784= ~I can understand what you feel, I have never even known my parents...~
@785= ~I can understand what you feel. I couldn't bear Gorion's death very well...~
@786= ~I understand, and I'm here for you, Kim.~
@787= ~(Gently hug Kim)~
@788= ~(Hold Kim's hand)~
@789= ~That's it? You shed your little tear? Can we go now?~
@790= ~(Her hand backs away while your fingers touch, but she relaxes suddenly, and you gently press her palm with yours for solace.)~
@791= ~(She pulls back suddenly, then lowers her eyes seeing your surprised look) I... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I know you try to console me, but I'm not very comfortable with being embraced at this moment. I hope you're not angry at me. Oh, you must think I'm unbearable!~
@792= ~Thank you for your support, <CHARNAME>. You don't realize how important it is for me, to be able to talk about it. I thought I had dealt with it so easily, but finally I feel that, now, two years later, I still haven't accepted the separation. Oh, I miss them so much!~
@793= ~Yes, it... it must be terrible not even knowing ones parents. But it's not the same either, because you didn't have any bond with them, there was no real separation.~
@794= ~Yes... yes, of course, you're right. I have at least comfort in knowing that they are alive, while in your case, you had to see your foster father die before your eyes. I guess you can understand me, indeed.~
@795= ~But I wonder if my pain and my nostalgia will stop one day. Have you been able to overcome your grief for Gorion?~
@796= ~I am not trying to overcome it. I don't want to lose his memory.~
@797= ~No. His memory still haunts me...~
@798= ~Yes, even if it took a long time.~
@799= ~I'm in a situation where I can't afford to be nostalgic.~
@800= ~I haven't shed a tear for the old fool!~
@801= ~That doesn't really answer my question, but I understand. You're right, it's stupid of me to dwell in the past when we have a bloodstained future ahead...~
@802= ~You... you reassure me, then. There may be hope for me. But perhaps it won't come that far. After all, one day or another we will kill this Irenicus.~
@803= ~After all these years? I... I understand <CHARNAME>, and it must be a difficult burden to wear. It's selfish, but I hope that I will never have to feel the same thing.~
@804= ~That's probably the best solution, isn't it? Carry in yourself the moments of joy like those of grief, and wait for time to do the sorting out. But I have to admit, <CHARNAME>, that I hope that I won't have to make that kind of choice...~
@805= ~When your quest is over, when no one threatens you anymore, I may go back to Baldur's Gate discreetly, who knows? Get news of my family?~
@806= ~Oh, but I have a great idea! What would you say to coming with me? After all, it's not as if you had other things to do as soon as Irenicus has been defeated, no? I could show you the more pleasant places in Baldur's Gate, so that you get a better appreciation of the city than you must have because of Sarevok... hey, and I will present you to my parents!~
@807= ~This is an excellent idea. I look forward to it!~
@808= ~Uh... this story about your parents... Are you asking me to marry you?~
@809= ~I don't know when all this will end, alas...~
@810= ~We'll see. Everything depends on where my destiny takes me.~
@811= ~No, Baldur's Gate has only bad memories for me.~
@812= ~When my quest is over, I hope you will disappear from my sight...~
@813= ~I see. Too bad, then, but it's a shame to imprison yourself in the past like that...~
@814= ~Rhaaa, how I hate it when you speak of destiny like that! I can't stand iiiiit!~
@815= ~Of course, we will see how things will develop, then...~
@816= ~Hey, you take your nightmares for reality! No, don't worry, my offer was without any ulterior motive. But now that you speak of it, hmm... (She evasively caresses your buttocks before turning away)~
@817= ~Well, what enthusiasm! That is good news. You see, <CHARNAME>, I'll show you the sunsets over the bay of Baldur, and the wind blowing in the creeks. I'll show you the Baldurdash gardens, hidden just behind the palace. And...~
@818= ~... and perhaps it's time that we get back on our way, the others are watching us strangely!~
@819= ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, I have a question that might be a little stupid, but I've been thinking about it for a long time...~ [kim2]
@820= ~Well go ahead, I'm listening.~
@821= ~A question a little stupid? Noooo, that's not your kind...~
@822= ~Well, keep it for yourself.~
@823= ~Hmpff... very well. I won't bother you anymore.~
@824= ~Am I dreaming or did I happen to hear a note of sarcasm and irony in your voice? But nooo, that's not your kind either. Huh!~
@825= ~In fact, I thought about all the perils that you are enduring to rescue Imoen, and I ask myself all sorts of questions... perhaps a little indiscreet, I admit. But I really would like to know...~
@826= ~What does Imoen mean to you? What's her place in your life? I mean, are you... perhaps... well, what do you feel for her?~
@827= ~Imoen is my sister, Kim. Nothing more.~
@828= ~Imoen was the only childhood friend I had, Kim. Nothing more.~
@829= ~Imoen is a brainless fool. It's not for her I'm doing all this, but to find Irenicus.~
@830= ~I don't really know, it's hard to say, but we have a special relationship.~
@831= ~Sometimes I wonder if I'm not in love with her, yes.~
@832= ~I love her, Kim. Didn't you realize?~
@833= ~You're right, it was a stupid question.~
@834= ~You... you...~
@835= ~I knew it!~
@836= ~I understand, <CHARNAME>. She must be someone really special to wake such feelings in you. I count on you to take care of her, most of all!~
@837= ~(Kim turns away slowly and retakes the road, her eyes dry.)~
@838= ~Oh yeah? Hmm, I see. But if you're still asking yourself, then it means that you are not yet fully under her spell, yes? Interesting... I'll remember.~
@839= ~A "special" relationship? This is a "special" answer, <CHARNAME>. But I suppose I should have guessed before, coming from you. Hmm, anyway, it's good to know. This Imoen seems dangerous to me... uh, I mean...~




@840= ~Oh? How can you speak with such a dry heart? I thought she was important to you, but I realize that, ultimately, she is only a pawn in your hands. We all are, aren't we? Well, this makes me tired, we'll continue this discussion another time.~
@841= ~Yes, I understand. There certainly haven't been many children in Candlekeep, that's obvious. Hey, I find it difficult to imagine you in the middle of monks and librarians! Nevertheless, it often happens that childhood friends suddenly become more than that, doesn't it? It only takes, I don't know, a kidnapping, perhaps. And then with relief of the reunion... hmm...~
@842= ~Sister, Sister, that's said so easily. You do not know your mother and your father was Bhaal. I have some doubts about the fact that she should have the same kinship as you. No, that's a deceptive argument, <CHARNAME>, and you know it. Hmm, I'm sure you hide something from me!~
@843= ~But what does she have more than me, exactly, this Imoen? I'm sorry to ask you a question so candid, but it continues to disturb me!~
@844= ~Maybe, one day, we will also become so close... or even more?~
@845= ~She has something special that I can't find in anyone else.~
@846= ~She has nothing more than you. You're much better than her!~
@847= ~You two are very different. I can't compare.~
@848= ~We share many memories, but that is also the case with you.~
@849= ~Well, she is cute, intelligent, strong and sensitive; all the opposite of you!~
@850= ~She knows when to speak and when to shut up...~
@851= ~Yes, I suppose that having spend all your childhood with her at your side, not to mention the episode with Sarevok, must have made you grow very close. I understand that you feel something very strong for her. I... I hope these days that we spend together, seeking this Irenicus and fighting hundreds of monsters, will also leave you some good memories...~
@852= ~Easy answer, gutless answer... but I guess you're right. After all, who could come close to me? I'm unique! I mean, who could be as beautiful, sensual, sweet and intelligent than I am? Seriously? Ha...~
@853= ~Ha! I don't know how to take it, but I guess I have to thank you, I didn't expect that. A compliment is always nice, although I am sure, you only said so to evade my question. Hey, I know you too well, <CHARNAME>!~
@854= ~Oh? I see, <CHARNAME>. I guess I shouldn't have asked, if I didn't want to get a honest answer.~
@855= ~Hmm... nice answer, but let's not be too quick, <PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>. Especially since I still have another question for you to ask. You didn't hope to escape it by complimenting me, did you?~
@856= ~All this leads me to wonder... what would you do, if I ever was in the same situation than Imoen? What would you do, if someone caught me? Would you come to my rescue?~
@857= ~Of course! I will never let a friend in danger.~
@858= ~Of course! You count very much for me.~
@859= ~Of course! My group could not function without a thief.~
@860= ~Of course! I will not let anyone provoke me like that!~
@861= ~Nobody will capture you as long as I am at your side.~
@862= ~No. You don't matter to me.~
@863= ~That was not my question, and you know it. Nobody can predict the future, and perhaps a powerful enemy will succeed in taking me away from you just like Irenicus did for Imoen. For the sake of our discussion, just assume that this was the case. Would you rescue me or not?~
@864= ~I see. You would help me just because of your pride and to get vengeance? I... I guess that's at least something to start with. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for your answers... and let's move on.~
@865= ~T. .. then I'm just that for you? A tool? A thief? I... I guess I was expecting something more, but ultimately it doesn't surprise me that much. Thank you for your honesty, <CHARNAME>. Let's continue with our journey.~
@866= ~Is it... it is true? You don't say that just to make me happy, do you? Oh, <CHARNAME>, I... *cough* thank you. That's all I wanted to know. Back on our way, ok?~
@867= ~A friend, eh? I... I guess you're right. That aren't really the words that I had hoped for, but they will do, if there is nothing else. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You are someone just and fair. Back on our way, now.~
@868= ~In fact, I was now thinking about all the perils that you have faced in order to rescue Imoen, and I asked myself all sorts of questions... perhaps a little indiscreet, I admit. But you went all the way to Spellhold to rescue her! Not everyone would be willing to do that. I really would like to know...~
@869= ~Wait, let's move a little away from the group. Quietly... there, like that. Whistle a bit, <CHARNAME>, to make it look inconspicuous... no, not like that, stupid! I guess it's difficult to sound natural, but I suppose it will do the trick. Imoen doesn't look in our direction, does she?~
@870= ~Well, no, but why...~
@871= ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, do you have a few seconds to spend for a question, that may be a little... indiscreet?~ [kim2]
@872= ~Sure, I listen!~
@873= ~It depends, how indiscreet is it?~
@874= ~No.~
@875= ~Oh... I guess I chose a bad time, huh? Alright.~
@876= ~Hey, so much distrust! You know that I wouldn't allow myself to get you into trouble, that is not my style...~
@877= ~Okay, having said that, consider yourself warned. I just asked myself questions about your taste in women, <CHARNAME>.~
@878= ~Hum...~
@879= ~No "hum" allowed this time. But of course you are not obliged to answer. Ready? Right, I'll make things easier for you. Brunette, blond or red hair?~
@880= ~Yum, brunettes!~
@881= ~Slurp, redheads!~
@882= ~Wuff, blondes!~
@883= ~It's not the most important.~
@884= ~I like bald women.~
@885= ~Joker...~
@886= ~Everything but you, Kim. Leave me in peace.~
@887= ~... I don't know how to respond to that.~
@888= ~Hey, agreed with the joker, <CHARNAME>. But I warn you, that will work only once.~
@889= ~Everyone has his own tastes, I suppose... hey, I've got the feeling that you're making fun of me! Alright, we'll see how you deal with my next questions.~
@890= ~Ding! Good answer! But admit that it doesn't help me that much to imagine your ideal woman, so let's continue...~
@891= ~Yuck! A blonde? But it's dull, a blonde. It's got that little taste of beer without alcohol. How could you like that? Well, anyway, let's continue with our small portrait...~
@892= ~Argh! A redhead? Didn't you hear the stories they tell about redheads? And then, it smells bad, a redhead. Yes, yes, I can assure you!~
@893= ~The choice of a connoisseur, dear <CHARNAME>. You're right, the brunettes aren't without merits! Power to brunettes! Woohoo!... Ahem. Let's continue with our questions...~
@894= ~What about the length of the hair?~
@895= ~Long hair~
@896= ~Half-long~
@897= ~Short~
@898= ~Doesn't matter~
@899= ~Bald, I said!~
@900= ~You're getting me tired, Kim. Go away!~
@901= ~Ah yes, well, inevitably! Okay, just imagine for a second...~
@902= ~Short? Don't you think it's a little boy like? Hmm, well, I suppose that nature knows all tastes.~
@903= ~Half-long? Hmm, that may have its charm I guess. I had half-long hair at a time, but I didn't like it too much. However, I take note, I take note...~
@904= ~Oh yeah? Hey, not very original, <CHARNAME>. I have a feeling that almost all men have the same taste. But I am pleased of your choice! (She slowly passes her hand through her luxuriant hair, then shakes it in the wind)~
@905= ~What, no opinion? Well, I guess that's your right, after all.~
@906= ~Well, it's noted, now to the next question:~
@907= ~The colour of her eyes?~
@908= ~Blue~
@909= ~Brown~
@910= ~Green~
@911= ~Oh? I can't agree! The colour of the eyes is important, I think. Well, maybe I'm superficial, after all. Alright, next question:~
@912= ~Ah, yes, a beautiful colour, isn't it? (She stare with her green eyes into yours and supports your look for a moment, before smiling gently) Well, where were we?~
@913= ~Brown eyes? Hmm, people say they prefer hazel, I think. But I know what you mean. Very well. (Her green eyes are stare into yours, somehow displaying regret, and she sighs) Next question:~
@914= ~Bah, blue eyes, blue eyes, what have you all got with your blue eyes? As if this was important, anyway, the colour of the eyes! Alright, next question:~
@915= ~Her personality?~
@916= ~Vivacious and joyful.~
@917= ~Reflective and reasonable.~
@918= ~Soft and tender.~
@919= ~Submissive and dutiful.~
@920= ~It doesn't matter.~
@921= ~Not yours, anyway. Leave me alone.~
@922= ~That's so incredible! So when one talks about the physique, this sir knows what to answer, but as soon as one talks about personality, there is nobody left? You should be ashamed, <CHARNAME>. In what way do you consider girls? As a commodity? Well, I'll end this discussion, it depresses me.~
@923= ~No opinion on the physique, no opinion on the personality, you know that you're hopeless? What does that mean... that any girl who desires you is well enough for you? Well, I'll end this discussion, it depresses me.~
@924= ~You see that? Our Lord likes his women to obey his every command. Well, I didn't imagine you to be like that at all, <CHARNAME>, and I must say that you disappoint me a lot. Go burn in hell!~
@925= ~Sweet and tender, huh? Hmm, I guess it's what most men want. The problem is that many confuse "soft and tender" with "submissive". But I guess a little tenderness can never hurt, huh?~
@926= ~Reflective and reasonable? Hmm, I wonder what you mean by that. Someone who does not follow his instincts? Someone who always weighs the pros and cons? Someone who doesn't ask stupid questions like I'm doing right now? Ha, I see, I see...~
@927= ~Vivacious and joyful? Hey, you're totally right, I think like you, <CHARNAME>. I mean, if I were a man, I would prefer girls who have energy, who are afraid of nothing, and who even dare to ask stupid questions to the men they encounter .. . I mean... hmm...~
@928= ~Good! I think I have taken note of everything. So, based on your answers, <CHARNAME>, here's your ideal girl:~
@929= ~A bald (yuck)...~
@930= ~A blonde (yuck)...~
@931= ~A redhead (yuck)...~
@932= ~A brunette (yes!)...~
@933= ~A girl whose hair may be the colour she likes...~
@934= ~... with short hair (what horror)...~
@935= ~... with half-long hair (mmmh)...~
@936= ~... with long hair (yes!)...~
@937= ~... with the hair length she prefers...~
@938= ~... green eyes (yes!)...~
@939= ~... brown eyes (mmh)...~
@940= ~... blue eyes (yuck)...~
@941= ~... any eye color will do...~
@942= ~... and a vivacious and joyful personality...~
@943= ~... and a thoughtful personality...~
@944= ~... and a sweet and tender personality...~
@9445= ~...and a personality she chooses depending on her mood...~
@945= ~In short, I realize that I did well to ask you these questions, <CHARNAME>. I don't know who your ideal woman is, but it's certainly not me... Hey, just imagine how things might have turned out if I hadn't realized this on time! Well, shall we move on?~
@946= ~In short, I realize that I did well to ask you these questions, <CHARNAME>. Your ideal woman is quite a bit different from me, no? Hey, don't look at me like that, I just asked this question without further intention. Well, it is high time to resume our journey.~
@947= ~It's... it's funny, don't you think, <CHARNAME>? It seems like I fit almost point for point into what you describe as your ideal woman. Hey, that's ridiculous, huh?~
@948= ~Well, let's get back on our way.~
@949= ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, do you remember our last discussion?~ [Kim2]
@950= ~Of course, when you were jealous of Imoen.~
@951= ~Of course, when you told me you were missing your parents.~
@952= ~Of course, when you asked me about my ideal woman.~
@953= ~I admit that I don't.~
@954= ~No, and it doesn't interest me.~
@955= ~Oh... I see. Well, if it doesn't interest you, I don't see why I wast my saliva for you.~
@956= ~Hmpff, frankly, was it worth it, that I wasted my saliva for someone like you? We were discussing your ideal woman. That's something that should have pleased you, right? About what you could drool? How can you forget that? Ah, bah... anyway...~
@957= ~Uh... no, not exactly, no. I have the feeling that you only listen to me with one ear, <CHARNAME>...~
@958= ~Yes, exactly. Well, I must say that I thought about it for a long time during our journey.~
@959= ~I thought that, after all and since you seemed so *comfortable* with indiscreet questions, I wouldn't refrain to ask you another one. And I'm not sure you going to get out there so easily, this time. Haha!~
@960= ~Have you ever fallen in love, <CHARNAME>? During the course of your life, in Candlekeep, or later on the roads, has there already been a girl that made your heart beat faster?~
@961= ~This actually is a question too indiscreet for me.~
@962= ~It happened to me, once.~
@963= ~I already happened to me several times, yes.~
@964= ~No, never.~
@965= ~No, you're the first.~
@966= ~No, but there was one girl who made me drunk. Leave me alone, Kim!~
@967= ~Uh...~
@968= ~I must say that I didn't think that the discussion would take that direction...~
@969= ~I think... that we should better to get back on road, don't you think so?~
@970= ~Yes, it's preferable.~
@971= ~Never, huh? Never did you have that slightly oppressed feeling, when your heart starts beating faster and you didn't find your words, impressed by the sheer proximity of the girl you're looking at? Ah, you don't know what you've been missing, <CHARNAME>!~
@972= ~Several times, eh? You are what they call a love addict, then? You fall in love like you fall from a horse's back? Hmm, I'm not sure to appreciate that kind of behaviour, <CHARNAME>. Had you told me that you have had many affaires, I could have believed. But having fallen in love several times? Love isn't lit so easily... but let's admit you tell the truth.~
@973= ~Once, huh? It had to be someone special, I am sure. Is it someone I know?~
@974= ~Yes... Aerie.~
@975= ~Yes... Jaheira.~
@976= ~Yes... Viconia.~
@977= ~Yes... Tashia.~
@978= ~Ooooh, the sir is playing the big shy one! But don't worry, little <CHARNAME>, I won't eat you! Come on, be nice, answer me... otherwise I'll start grumbling!~
@979= ~And these girls... what did you do with them? Did you kiss them? Did you... uh... have intercourse with some of them?~
@980= ~Is there any point in this interrogation?~
@981= ~Well, yes, actually.~
@982= ~Of course.~
@983= ~No, it was very platonic...~
@984= ~Oh... I see. But this girl... what did you do with her? You've kissed her? Did you... sleep with her?~
@985= ~Oh... I... I see. Well, I must confess that I feel quite uncomfortable to talk to you about this, while she is next to us... Perhaps another time?~
@986= ~Oh well, I suppose it's kind of cute to see you as a virgin. It gives you a little affecting charm that suits you well. Hey, do me a smile, <CHARNAME>... *goolly, goolly*~
@987= ~'ola, I touched a sensitive subject, it seems. Very well, I won't talk about no more.~
@988= ~Ha! No need to blush like that, <CHARNAME>. Everyone has a past, and all of us lived some adventures. That's fine, having some experience, you know; if it wasn't the case, I would have asked myself some serious questions, at your age. A pretty boy like you! Haha...~
@989= ~Hmpfff... what does this mean, "of course"? That nobody can resist your charm? That all women are there just to give you pleasure? You're pathetic, <CHARNAME>. Or, you express yourself awkwardly. Hey, I sincerely hope that it's the second option.~
@990= ~Oh... Wow! I must say that I wasn't expecting that. At your age, you have no experience? Ho ho...~
@991= ~As for me, it's really calm. I have to admit something to you... men disgust me. They are dirty, brutal, violent, aggressive, domineering, and unable to think beyond their own pleasure.~
@992= ~You... you like women?~
@993= ~Not all men are like that, Kim.~
@994= ~(Hug Kim to comfort her)~
@995= ~Don't try to find excuses. It's simply that you don't appeal to anyone.~
@996= ~(She escapes from your arms and gazes at you furiously) You see? You see? That's exactly what mean!~
@997= ~Oh yeah? Really? And who do you think about, for example?~
@998= ~Well... me, for example?~
@999= ~If you didn't figure it out yet, I will let you search a bit longer...~
@1000= ~(Hug Kim without answering)~
@1001= ~Me? No! No, of course not... even though sometimes I tell myself that a woman would probably be softer and more understanding. But I think the discussion goes into a direction I don't really like. We will discuss some more another day, yes?~
@1002= ~Mmmh... (Kim deviates a bit from you, with a thoughtful air. Obviously, you've agitated her. )~
@1003= ~You? Mmm, that remains to be seen! But for now, I must confess that you're not doing too badly, overall...~
@1004= ~But let's continue our quest, we dawdled enough already.~
@1005= ~Here, <CHARNAME>, I composed a little song, would you like to hear it?~ [Kim2]
@1006= ~Uh... a song? Yes, of course!~
@1007= ~I would have preferred a romantic poem, but go ahead anyway.~
@1008= ~Certainly not. You have a pathetic voice.~
@1009= ~Pathetic? My voice? Have you already heard yourself? Hmpff!~
@1010= ~But there are very romantic songs, you know? Well, I must say that I am more focused on drinking songs, but still!~
@1011= ~Okay, are you ready? Open your ears and don't pay attention to the false notes!~
@1012= ~"It's a strange story that I want to tell, 
About a man who became an adventurer. 
His father was a god, a killer, a murderer 
And they were too little to wish him well."~
@1013= ~"But despite the dangers and devious monsters, 
The man I spoke survived, it's true.
He found friends that surrounded him with care; 
One may be god's child, yet stay <PRO_RACE>." 

Now listen, <CHARNAME>, here's the refrain! Clap your hands!~
@1014= ~"Stamp your feet, 
Take out the sword 
Kill your enemies! 
To taste, 
How Delightful, 
Glory and life!"~
@1015= ~"One day the boy will found rest. 
Put away sword and backpack.
And quietly, will he tell Bhaal, the god, his father: 
"Real power is love, not war!"~
@1016= ~So what you do think about it?~
@1017= ~...~
@1018= ~Magnificent, what talent, what voice, splendid, more. more!~
@1019= ~Hmm... is there a hidden meaning somewhere?~
@1020= ~Uh... is it just, or was it awful?~
@1021= ~This is a simple song, <CHARNAME>. The inspiration came to me and I composed while we were walking. Why do you think it might have a hidden meaning? Hey, you're too wary... and too proud, if you think that the song is about you.~
@1022= ~Hey, I wonder if that was a sincere compliment. But I didn't write it for your approval, anyway, but for my personal pleasure. Too bad I don't know how to play an instrument, I'm sure it would sound really good, accompanied by a violin or a flute. ~
@1023= ~Well, well? The great <CHARNAME> is silent? What happens, you lost your tongue? You better to find her again, because I think it's not very fair that I am the only one to work here.~
@1024= ~Well, now it's your turn. Would you like to compose a little poem or a little song?~
@1025= ~Uh... here, just like that, right now?~
@1026= ~Of course! Don't you worry, I promise you that I won't laugh. Come on, I'm listening!~
@1027= ~Okay, I'll try!~
@1028= ~Hmpff, but only to make you happy...~
@1029= ~This is out of question.~
@1030= ~Bah! Courage also applies outside of the battlefield, <CHARNAME>. You're a coward.~
@1031= ~But I don't doubt it, dear, I don't doubt it!~
@1032= ~So, I'm listening. Go ahead, be courageous!~
@1033= ~There was once a stubborn girl / Who asked a boy to write a poem
The boy knows not to talk so well/ The only thing he could say is "I love you".~
@1034= ~There was once a proud pirate / With a big arrogant air, fine nose and fine skin too. 
She wanted - what mistake - to make me sing / I feel that the storm will soon break through.~
@1035= ~There was once a cute swashbuckler / Who remained a thief nevertheless
She stole my heart, and so today I repeat / "Give it back" or at least be gentle with it...~
@1036= ~You're tiresome, Kim, with all your wishes / And don't think I'll answer your desires.
Don't look at me with this stupid gaze / For you and me, there is no chance!~
@1037= ~That's... well done, <CHARNAME>. You do really have... some poetic talents (She moves away slowly and you see as she furtively wipes a tear away as she rejoins the group)~
@1038= ~Hey... ah...~
@1039= ~(She looks at you for a moment, visibly troubled. This is the first time you see her unable to find any words.)~
@1040= ~I... I think I'll leave you for a moment <CHARNAME>. I really wasn't expecting that.~
@1041= ~Hey! Bravo, a very beautiful poem! You see, if you want to...~
@1042= ~Well, you haven't reached my level, but you're improving, that's for sure! Ha...~
@10425= ~I always loved watching the stars from the deck of a ship, there is nothing comparable! Far from the city, the sky is imbued with majesty. What would you say about leaving the city and all these buildings to admire the sky tonight?~
@1043= ~This night is delicious. The sky is clear and the stars shine like thousands of small candles...~ [kim2]
@1044= ~Come sit beside me, <CHARNAME>. It's still early, and this spectacle is worthwhile. Look how beautiful the moon is tonight!~
@1045= ~Are you crazy? We have no time to lose, let's move on.~
@1046= ~It's not the night, but your presence that is magic...~
@1047= ~You're right. The sky is totally clear today.~
@1048= ~Hmpff... I see. Well, I'll watch them alone, in that case.~
@1049= ~Well, well, <CHARNAME>, don't be so overexcited. Why don't you rather come lie on the grass, watch the sky with me...~
@1050= ~I have always loved the stars. They are so distant and so close at the same time, so relaxing. It looks like thousands of small lives that shine only for us.~
@1051= ~When I was on watch on our ship, I watched them, and it lessened my concerns. That's where I learned about the constellations. Look, there is the Great Archer!~
@1052= ~I don't see anything.~
@1053= ~Looks more like a hunchback than an archer, honestly. Who came up with these names?~
@1054= ~You're in a poetic mood, it seems...~
@1055= ~Is there a constellation of lovers?~
@1056= ~You're tiring me, Kim. I will leave you to your dreaming.~
@1057= ~Lovers, no, but look at these two stars that shine all up there. That is the constellation of those "fallen in love". It is said that their love was so powerful that they transformed into light after their death, to go enlighten those who have feelings for one another.~
@1058= ~It's not me who is in a poetic mood, it's you who is in an absolute "down to earth" mood! Frankly, <CHARNAME>, doesn't this impress you at all, all these bright spots? Don't you feel particularly small?~
@1059= ~Huh? How's that? Aaah, no, you look at it upside down, that's all. Look, his head is on the left, and there is his bow. Hey, but it's true, it still looks like a hunchback...~
@1060= ~There, stupid! To the left of my finger. Eight stars that form a silhouette. Can you see it better now? Oh hell, are you blind or what? Did a dust mephitis blow at you recently? *Arrgh*~
@1061= ~I feel ridiculously small, in face of this vastness. I sometimes feel we are nothing. That we do not weigh anything. Thank you watching the stars with me, <CHARNAME>. It means a lot to me. I... I feel good with you.~
@1062= ~(She turns to you and her smile seems frozen while her breath is accelerating. You are alone, lying on the ground, quietly watching the sky. A little fresh wind shakes her hair, when you realize that all your companions have quietly left.)~
@1063= ~(Caress Kim's hair)~
@1064= ~(Embrace Kim)~
@1065= ~(Caress Kim's breasts)~
@1066= ~(Stay idle and admire the sky)~
@1067= ~(Kiss Kim)~
@1068= ~(Kiss Kim on the forehead)~
@1069= ~(Fend off Kim and get back to the road)~
@1070= ~(She seems surprised as you gently approach her face. Tenderly, you leave a chaste kiss on her forehead.)~
@1071= ~(Slowly, you draw your face near hers. Before she could understand your intentions, your lips touch.)~
@1072= ~(You feel Kim stirring next to you, and you have more and more difficulties to concentrate on the sky.)~
@1073= ~(Continue to do nothing)~
@1074= ~(Careful, you let your fingers slip over to her, and put your impatient hand on her breasts. The feeling is tremendous.)~
@1075= ~(Smiling softly, you let your arms go down and gently caress Kim's fingers. Despite hours of training with the sword, her hand is soft and delicate, like that of an artist.)~
@1076= ~(Slowly you turn to your side. Before she has the time to articulate a protest, you pass your arm under her neck, leaving her head lying against your shoulder.)~
@1077= ~(You swallowed, and your hand is slowly approaching her hair. Grabbing all your courage, you begin to caress them gently, as if you were trying to comb them.)~
@1078= ~What... what are you doing? <CHARNAME>, stop it immediately!~
@1079= ~Who do you take me for? Who told you, you should do that?~
@1080= ~I don't feel anything for you, you understand? NOTHING! And it was stupid of me to think that you would accept to quietly watch the stars with me. Let us rejoin the others, <CHARNAME>, quickly. I will take no more risks with you.~
@1081= ~What... what are you doing, <CHARNAME>? (She slowly moves away, but doesn't seem particularly upset. You even see that she smiles at you, with a rather amused air.)~
@1082= ~(Don't move)~
@1083= ~(Caress Kim's hair)~
@1084= ~You... I... (Before you have time to react, it is her who takes the initiative and fiercely kisses you. Your breathing accelerates as you feel her fine body against yours, and the scent of wild flowers against your back. You bless the moon and the stars for having shined tonight, when your excitement grows stronger and you hold her tight in your arms, her mouth against yours.)~
@1085= ~We have to... MmmPhhh!~
@1086= ~I... hhhnnnnmpf...~
@1087= ~Wai...t... mMmpfhhh...~
@1088= ~(Push Kim away)~
@1089= ~(You remain there a long time without saying anything. Finally, you hear as Kim breathes a sigh and turns to you.)~
@1090= ~I'm sorry... you're... very cute, <CHARNAME>, but frankly I don't think this will work. You're too... shy, and hesitant. I'm sorry. Let's get back on our way, Okay?~
@1091= ~(Your lips touch her forehead, and she smiles gently. But you have a feeling of hesitation. Does she see you as a brother or a lover? There is only one way to know...)~
@1092= ~Chhhhhtttt...~
@1093= ~You lose any notion of time as she lies in your arms. You feel her soft skin against yours, and her lips avidly seeking your mouth. She moans softly like an injured cat as you squeeze her against your chest, and her eyes shut partly as she lets herself fall.~
@1094= ~Hmm, the other wait for us... Perhaps we should go now, right?~
@1095= ~(You see how fury is turning into incomprehension as you leave her like that.)~
@1096= ~What? You dare to... I... <CHARNAME>, I think we've got nothing to tell each other anymore!~
@1097= ~(Your timid approach is rewarded by a derisive snorting as she turns to you.)~
@1098= ~(You take advantage of your first kiss on her forehead to get closer to her, until your bodies touch. Her breathing is accelerating.)~
@1099= ~(She smiles tenderly, and you feel a pinch in your heart while you admire her slim silhouette drawn in the backlight of the moon.)~
@1100= ~You're right, <CHARNAME>. Let's go. But don't think you can escape from me so easily!~
@1101= ~I didn't hope so at all! Roaaar!~
@1102= ~You don't understand, it seems. I don't want you!~
@1103= ~I see that we're on the same wavelength... my love!~
@1104= ~<CHARNAME>, we need to talk.~ [Kim2]
@1105= ~What we did last time, while watching the stars, it was...~
@1106= ~... a mistake.~
@1107= ~... a magical moment...~
@1108= ~... not too soon!~
@1109= ~... yes?~
@1110= ~(Her expression hardens) Yes, a mistake. That will never happen again. That's what I wanted to tell you. Let's keep moving!~
@1111= ~Hey, yes, I though so too. I have the impression that we know each other for years. Yet, it's not been such a long time...~
@1112= ~Magical, yes. I just hope it's not black magic, <CHARNAME>...~
@1113= ~I want you to be honest with me, <CHARNAME>. Really honest. I don't want any anxiety between us. That is something very important for me, and I would like to get a sincere answer from you.~
@1114= ~Do you have any regrets about what happened? I mean... in that illustrious night?~
@1115= ~Yes, I don't know what took me...~
@1116= ~Yes. To hell with the others, we should have gone further then!~
@1117= ~No, absolutely not!~
@1118= ~Of course, it was a mistake to kiss a girl like you!~
@1119= ~And I think that neither I...~
@1120= ~You... think?~
@1121= ~Further, huh? I wonder what you mean by that, <CHARNAME>. But I don't really want to know...~
@1122= ~How's that?~
@1123= ~Hah, I don't know what made me act like that either. But...~
@1124= ~But...?~
@1125= ~I mean, everything happened on an impulse of the moment! But I still don't know what this is between us, <CHARNAME>. I don't know, I don't understand.~
@1126= ~It has nothing to do with you, but I am wary of men in general, and their promises. Why have we kissed, <CHARNAME>? Why? How do you consider myself now? What do you feel for me? Are you capable to tell me?~
@1127= ~I love you...~
@1128= ~I have great affection for you.~
@1129= ~I feel good with you.~
@1130= ~I'm attracted to you...~
@1131= ~I would like to know you better.~
@1132= ~You're only here to serve my pleasure!~
@1133= ~I... see. So I have done well to ask. Let it be clear between us, <CHARNAME>: one more inappropriate gesture, and I'll slice your throat!~
@1134= ~And I'd like to know you better, too. You're absolutely right! It's not by those few fragmented conversations that you can know what my life is like, and neither can I know yours. But as time goes by...~
@1135= ~Attracted by me, huh? So, then, what attracts you? My conversation, or my breasts?~
@1136= ~Me too, I feel good with you, <CHARNAME>. Very good. But is that enough to build a relationship?~
@1137= ~Me too, I feel great affection for you, <CHARNAME>. A lot. But is that enough to build a relationship?~
@1138= ~You love me, huh? It's been only a few days that we know each other, and already great declarations of love? Ah, you're just a love addict!~
@1139= ~You don't say anything? Ah, you see, I knew the words wouldn't follow. You don't love me, <CHARNAME>, not yet, that's for sure. But that will come!~
@1140= ~Let's get back on the road. I will always keep the memory of the time we spent under the stars in my heart, but I think we should give us some time, before we find us lying on the ground again, in the arms of each other. What do you say, my little muskrat?~
@1141= ~Ah, I think that in the meantime, I'm going to have much fun giving you cute little names. Come-on, lets get back to the others, my wild canary!~
@1142= ~You're right, my river otter!~
@1143= ~Here we go then, my faithful doggie!~
@1144= ~I am following you, my sweet island skunk!~
@1145= ~Forward, my little cormorant!~
@1146= ~Skunk... isn't that the female ferret? What an elegant way to tell me that I smell bad...~
@1147= ~That was so cute, <CHARNAME>. A good point for you! Haha.~
@1148= ~Doggie, yeah? Wuff!~
